I Like It When It's Stormy;Hank Williams Jr.;Blues;https://open.spotify.com/track/0RGaAfyeo6VspXL6eK3l4l;"Cold heart moved in
And the rain came down
That's the way the weather's been
Since she come around
No the sun don't shine
'Round here much anytime
Old cabin fever
Make you lose your mind
Cause she's gone out again
With her fair weather friends
This thing is turning to pain
This storm will put out the flame
I like it when it's stormy
Cause it reminds me of my life
When lightning strikes without warning
Like it has in my world once or twice
I hear the thunder rolling
Feel the icy, cold, hail storms
I like it when it's stormy
But i don't like being alone
I like it when it's stormy
Blowing a hard rain
Looking out my window
Wishing you was coming back again
Oh the things that we do
On a day like this
I'm gonna find me somebody new
That likes to hear the thunder
Feel the icy, cold, hail storms
I like it when it's stormy
But i don't like being alone";en;0.9999976252466184

The Man Was Burning;Jake Blount;Blues;https://open.spotify.com/track/5X8hjt33EdQ8KUaUzcTNQv;"People in the land of Georgia
Little they cared about God
When the news got in the land that
Man was burning on the log
That man was countin' his money
Yeah, he was grinnin' mighty broad
He held a greenback dollar aloft, said
""This money gonna make me a god""
I'll tell you 'bout the man was burning
Way down yonder in the land of Georgia
Yes, a man was burning
For blasphemin' the name of God
People in the land of Georgia
Prudent would not stay
So they sent for a saw
Just to try to get him away (Get him away)
When that saw did come (Hah, hah)
Began to sawin' that log (Hah, hah)
Well, as thе sawdust fell, (Hah, hah)
It commenced a-drippin' blood (Blood will fall)
Thе people gathered to witness
His friends got frightened and scared
As flames of fire came out of his mouth
Came through his nose and ears
I'll tell you 'bout the man was burning
Way down yonder in the land of Georgia
This-a man was burning

Lived back in the woods
Drove a 4-wheel drive pickup
Kept it running good

The thing was bad to smoke
Spent his spare time fishing
In a 10-foot aluminum boat
Cause there was a lot of money to be had
For the man who caught the world record large-mouth bass
Bubba had a dream one night
Everything seemed surreal
He caught a bass that weighed 25 pounds
On a Zebco spinning reel
He was getting anxious
But he waited till the moon was right
He loaded up his truck and boat
Headed out before daylight
He stopped for bologna and crackers, and a little gas
And he was off to catch a world record large-mouth bass
He had a small fortune in plastic worms, auto fishing lures
He's throwing them hard, and throwing them long
Nothing was doin' no good
Then he looked inside his tackle box
Seen a lure his grandpa made
He tied it on and he let it go
Over in a cyprus shade
He let it sit real still, wiggled it kinda slow
Then it seemed like the whole lake exploded
And it shook him down to his toes
Bubba said mmm..
Believe I got something here that might last
It just might be the world record large-mouth bass
But he knew he was in trouble
Knew it was out of hand
When it almost jerked him out of his boat
That's when he swallowed his Redman
And that 'ole bass came up on top of the water
Started dancing his tail
And it sounded something like
Bubba, Bubba, Bubba, Bubba, Bubba
Well it broke his line and blew his mind
Then he started to shake
But he finally got ahold of himself
Had a little Gatorade
Bubba was down and out, but he had class
When he shook his fist and said

Do you walk the streets at night?
Try to stay beneath the light?
Do you sense it as you go?
Maybe you are not alone
An angel walks
An angel prays
By your side at night unseen in the alleyways
Who guides the hand that comes to play?
Like BB King and Stevie Ray
Who takes the pain we didn't choose?
Turns it into Chicago Blues
An angel walks
An angel prays
By your side at night down through the alleyways
A junkie cries and no one hеars
A spirit flies to dry his tears
The bottlе owns another man
Until he takes the helping hand
A spirit walks
An angel prays
By your side at night unseen through the alleyways
Who knows the spirit who walks beside?
To light and guard, to rule and guide
They walk with Peter, they walk with Paul
Wrestled with Jacob and with us all
An angel walks
An angel prays
By your side at night down through the alleyways
There's angels all around, I know, don't you?
There's angels all around, I know, don't you?
Times when you can't find the word
It comes to you as if you heard
Someone's voice from long ago
Tells you what you need to know
An angel walks
Oh, prays!
By your side at night, child, down in the alleyways
There's angels all around, I know, don't you?

My baby showed up and said, ""I will tell you when""
I’m tore down, almost level with the ground

Well, I feel like this when my baby can’t be found
Love you, babe, with all my heart and soul
Love like mine will never grow old
Love you in the morning and in the evening too
Every time you leave me, I get mad with you

Well I feel like this when my baby can’t be found

Love like mine is out of sight
I'd lie for you, if you want me to

Watch their grandkids collide, let it break you inside

Do you want to hear me beg you to take me back?

That I ran from in disgrace

Seven hours, seven days or seven years?

Drowning in a river of tears
Drowning in a river
Feel like I'm drowning
Drowning in a river
In three more days, I'll leave this town
And disappear without a trace
A year from now, maybe settle down
Where no one knows my face
I wish that I could hold you
One more time to ease the pain
But my time's run out and I got to go
Got to run away again
Still I catch myself thinking
One day I'll find my way back here

Put a rock on your finger and he vowed you a second chance
Built a house right by the coast

Money talks, but I ain't buyin'

Buy Dirt;Jordan Davis, Luke Bryan;Country;https://open.spotify.com/track/69AIpwGNLxr4qS1X5ynx60;"Few days before he turned 80

He said ""What you been up to lately?""
I told him chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out
Said ""If you want my two cents on making a dollar count
Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt""
Before you get caught on that ladder
Let me tell you what it's all about
Find you a few things that matter
That you can put a fence around
And then he laid it out
Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground

And throw a little money in the plate at church

I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

But here she is, free, lyin' next to me
'Cause I ain't tryna tame her love
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned
Just lookin' for somebody as wild as her
Wild
Wild
Saw that highway unwind in her deep-brown eyes
She saw a long stretch of dirt road dreamin' in mine
She ain't livin' for a diamond ring
Just livin' like the rock 'n' roll song she sings out loud
We're burnin' it down
Blazin' up a trail of smoke
Wherever we are, wherever we go
Yeah, that's where she calls home
I keep the windows down and the wind in her hair
Keep her heart hangin' on 'round every turn
She ain't scared to get tied down, scared to get burned

Yeah, yeah, man
Yeah
I ain't tryna fix her, I just wanna kiss her
Fuel a little fire in her soul
No, we don't say ""forever,"" but when we're together
Swear that we ain't ever lettin' go, yeah, she knows

Doin' This;Luke Combs;Country;https://open.spotify.com/track/6TpyujRefwsflWFXbmjVpj;"Someone asked me once in an interview
""What was growing up like?""
""Where'd you go to school?""
""And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?""
I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge
Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job, just makin' due
With tips in a jar, my guitar, and an old barstool
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this
I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CD's just to give away
Payin' his dues
If I wasn't doin' this
Five deep in a van, head full of steam
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true
Livin' this life just like I was born to do
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage

It ain't about the fortune
It ain't about the name
It ain't about the glory

What My World Spins Around;Jordan Davis;Country;https://open.spotify.com/track/6HBRLaSQ7NB8MNlaqzYen1;"I love a first cast when the water's glass and the line starts to run
Or that first sip of a cold beer when the working week's done

With the windows down on the first ride in a paid-up truck
And I love a slow down in a beach town with an ocean view
And I love a first fall Saturday trip down to Baton Rouge
And I love a six-string with the stars out and the campfire glow
But girl, that don't even come close
To the way that it feels when you lean in and kiss me
The way that you dance when you get kinda tipsy
I'm wrapped 'round your finger like this ring I'm wearin'
That look in your eye, girl, when you catch me starin'
And I don't even know what it is, but now that I found it
I can't imagine me livin' without this
Back forty view on our piece of ground
Watching you watch the sun going down
That's what my world spins around
Well, I finally get it now, when they say you know, you know
And yeah, girl, you had me from that first hello
And the only thing better is Heaven above

Tell me every single secret in your mind

You only used to smoke when you drank
When you lived in Chicago
Unsure where the wind blows

And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

""Why did you let her go?""
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had?
Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me
But now that we're done and it's over

But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave

So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay your way to your seat
It's the best seat, in the best room
Oh, he's so smug, Mr. ""Always wins""
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything
And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss ""Here to stay""
Now I'm Miss ""Gonna be alright someday""
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then, you'll be Mr. ""Too late""

With ladies waitin' in town

As the sun burns away the spring
The coastlines start to sing
With the young and heartless
Hilton head and the Hamptons
Where the rich all go to die
The young kids all get high
Just to pass time
I bought a bottle of the best bourbon
A beat-down boy could buy
I'm gonna bury all my sorrow
As the summertime passes by

You were napping on my arms on a Sunday afternoon
But, babe, I've gotta heal myself from the things I've never felt
Repression is my heaven but I'd rather go through hell

'Bout time that I face
The hard times I've let go

I would drown before I float

When I gave you all I had, but it still let you down?
Everyone I've ever loved has either left or died
Wish I was born with concrete shoes, but I'm leaving tonight

And I'd drink my whiskey and she'd drink wine

Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
Talking down to me like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have
And I gave to you my best
And we both know you can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
(Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)
We might still be in love, if you were a better man
(But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man)
Yeah, yeah
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand

My thoughts get drowned until I feel alright
I keep drinkin' 'til I'm someone I don't recognize

Repeat the cycle every day, I gotta start with a drink
My life been getting sorta crazy and I don't wanna think
I look myself right in the mirror and I don't even blink
Then I get angry, take the rest and pour it right in the sink
I know where this road goes
Alcohol ain't my friend, but I keep drinkin' 'cause these demons roam
And follow me 'round everywhere I go
It clouds my mind and soul, it turns my heart cold
But I keep drinkin' 'cause it makes me feel like I'm not alone
I'm havin' problems, my pride won't let me reach out
Lookin' at this bottle, havin' nothin' but doubt
Don't wanna drink, but it keeps comin' around and around and around

'Cause they watchin' when I'm in there, but I'm scared
'Cause I've been chasin' the man that I am when I start to drink
He's cocky, confident and he don't give a damn what you think
This world is beatin' me down, it has pushed me right to the brink
I take a shot every time because man it helps me escape
I'm takin' care of these people, but no one takes care of me
I wanna talk to somebody, but I feel no one relates
I need better now, I think I've lost my way
I'm havin' battles with faith, it's painted right on my face
I hope better times are comin', no chase but I'm still runnin'
I gotta take control, and I won't stop for nothin'
Dear God, this is my test, promise that I'll do my best

Did I overstep the line we've been walking?
Swear I wasn't even drunk
So if I said too much
Oh, that was just the love talking
When I said you're the only one
I'm ever gonna need, ever gonna want
Don't know what camе over me, that was just the lovе
When I let it slip that I
Wanted you for my whole life
And you and me turned into us, that was just the love talking
Talking
Talking, talking, talking
I got no excuses
Plain and honest truth is
I've been holding on to this for a long, long time
Still hungover
Never been more sober
Can't blame a liquor buzz

Cut a path through the grass, yelling, ""Kiss my ass!""

We laughed, we drank, every now and then I think
Man, I'd love to do that again

Those were the best nights

Was shinin' any brighter than it is tonight
But it looked on fire back then
It probably wasn't, but it seemed a little better back when
Gravel lot spot by the porta J'ohns
'Bout a quarter mile from the door
Worked three weeks for a pair of cheap seats
To hear ""Never Wanted Nothing More""
We were feelin' that buzz from a summertime love
And a bottle tucked in a boot

Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

Here's to silence that cuts me to the core

But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

It can put a Rollie on a redneck
Slap a barn on a farm with a white fence
And don't forget to give the good Lord His 10%
And when you do, it'll do what it does
Put a new church where the old church was

And I've been thinkin' of you in the morning times
You woke me up so soft that I forgot the world ain't kind
I pull you in and you kissed me through a grin
And you say you missed me when you were busy sleepin'

Is the way that I reckon it should be
And if you called you'd say that you're okay
And I'd be wishin' I was there
'Cause you're happy instead
Happy instead
And I've been dreamin' of the life we would have had
Happy at times but mostly just mad
Maybe it'd worked out, maybe it'd be fine
But every day your smile ain't showin', seems a waste of time

And I'd be wishin' I was there
'Cause you're happy instead
Happy instead

When you called last night and my child up and jumped
He asked who you were and you did the same
Handed me the phone and I couldn't recall your name

Fifteen (Taylor’s Version);Taylor Swift;Country;https://open.spotify.com/track/2nqio0SfWg6gh2eCtfuMa5;"You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

You know, you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me

Held out, and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
Well I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then
And I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on

Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean

And found out what it was to turn around

With your window down, brown hair, blowin’ look at me like that
A turned up radio but the static was heavy
Couldn’t make out any words but “take me to the levee”
That look on your face was full of wild desire
Soakin’ my soul in gas and settin’ my heart on fire
Heart on fire, heart on fire, heart on fire
I don’t have a single second thought that doesn’t have you in it
To feel those flames again, I go back in a New York minute
I miss the freedom of you dancing on the bow of your daddy’s old boat
When my spirit starts sinkin’ that picture always makes it float baby
We weren’t old enough to drink but we damn sure did it
Hat turned backward singin’ “Paradise City”

When you hear somebody start to say my name
Oh, when you think of me
I hope you think good things
I hope you think, think good things
I hope you think, think good things
I hope you
Picture that night in Portland
We drank three bottles of wine
I said I love you 'bout a million times
And then we drove to Seattle
And just to kiss in the rain
Now when it's pourin', do you see my face?

When you hear somebody start to say my name

Whiskey Sour;Kane Brown;Country;https://open.spotify.com/track/1wlbeqO0XpftrT2pVqcxaL;"We were two heartbeats away
From wedding rings and a pretty ballgown dress
At the church off 40 West
And we were talking 'bout our future on the steps
Of your daddy's screened in porch
That if I'd ask, you'd tell me, ""yes""
Well, it only took a month or so to be someone you used to know
You didn't really have to go, but you did
And I've never been a somber soul
But part of me ain't here no more
And I've been tryna find him ever since
So now I take my whiskey sour
Sittin' barside after hours
Thinkin' how can I get over if the love was never ours?
Hell, I know you got my message
All my X's and my O's
And it kills me by the hour
Now I take my whiskey sours alone
'Cause that one night under neon
Was the first time you ordered me one
And you told me that you loved me
But was it ever true?
'Cause your promises were empty
Now I'm drinkin' one too many
Drowning out the memory of you
So now I take my whiskey sour
Sitting barside after hours
Thinking how can I get over if the love was never ours?
Hell, I know you got my message
All my X's and my O's
And it kills me by the hour
Now I take my whiskey sours
And I don't know why I do it
It's supposed to help me through it
But it's harder when it always tastes like you
And every time I hit rock bottom
I don't know what I should do
Should I call you up again or should I settle for round two?
And just take my whiskey sour
Sitting barside after hours
Thinking how can I get over if the love was never ours?
Hell, I know you got my message
All my X's and my O's
And it kills me by the hour

Country Again;Thomas Rhett;Country;https://open.spotify.com/track/3CiF9D8iuVhZWDvvjf8HpG;"I quit huntin' with my daddy, guess I didn't make the time

The other day I hooked a monster, and as I reeled him in
I thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""
I spent way less time in Nashville, more time in L.A
My back home buddies, they quit callin', thought I had too much on my plate
But last night, we cracked some cold beers and cranked Eric Church to ten
Thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""
Yeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again
I traded in my Silverado, didn't need no four-by-four
I tucked my boots in the back of the closet, they didn't feel like me no more
But I dug 'em out and slipped 'em on, they've been on my feet since then
Man, it feels good to be country again

That fit me right
Chew some tobacco
Ride me a Bronco
On a southern Saturday night
I ain't never rode a horse
Or worn a cowboy hat
But I'll find me one that fits my head
And she won't know any of that
I keep walking this town
Tryna get me some advice
But all the ranch hands around
Keep on sayin' they wanna fight
And I learned to two step, so I can spin her
Off her pretty little country feet
If she wants a cowboy
Then I'll be as cowboy
As a cowboy can be
Find me a horse that I can cover
Find me some stars to sleep under
Find me a train, I'll hop out west
If she wants a cowboy, I'll cowboy the best
She wanted a cowboy, so I went off
And rode me a horse about every day
Got pretty good at ranching and riding
But she, didn't care anyway
Champion buckles, and champion spurs
I got everything but her
Now I'm a cowboy and she wants Nashville
What the hell was all this worth
Find me a horse that I can cover
Find me some stars to sleep under
Find me a train, I'll hop out west
If she wants Nashville, I'll Nashville the best

Her feet in the sea
Lived so much life before I fell in her arms
Spent years becoming the man that she'd need
Funny, now I feel like a boy, so disarmed

I like to see you wiggle, wiggle, for sure
It makes me want to dribble, dribble, you know
Riding in my Fiat, you really have to see it
Six-feet-two in a compact, no slack
But luckily the seats go back
I got a knack to relax in my mind
Sipping some red, red wine
Shepherd's Bush, my compact push
Notting Hill Gate, my Fiat skate
With a crate of Cabernet, but not today
Because I gotta drive, I wanna stay alive
Not 'cause it's illicit, do I have to get explicit?
As a matter of fact, I sip on the yak
With Big and Reecе, 200 diamonds in their piece
I'm trying to gеt mine, so I can shine

I know it's my fault, I pick up your phone calls
When it's half-past one, and you're halfway drunk
You say you love me, and it sounds so dumb
But you're the only one I can't run away from
The same old songs

Wishing there was something left to lose
This could be the day I die for you

Blinding flashes getting closer
Wish that I had something left to lose
This could be the day I die for you

And I'm sipping on my tea
I've got all day long

I start on Second Avenue
Making my way downtown to you
Maybe I'll make a stop at Bang Bang
Get myself a new tattoo
Then I find me a secret garden
And I sit down with my book
But I'm not planning on reading
I'm just here to have a look
At people in and out of stores

Maybe he just got off a tour

With the best smile I've ever seen
I put my book away
And walk over to him in my blue jeans
We start to talk about something
Then I suggest we get a drink
Let's bike over the bridge to Brooklyn
You tell me, what do you think?
And so we head to Miss Favela
For the live music at three
And we're dancing on the pavement
Just like everybody
We dance until we hit the floor
I think we should head out the door
Then we meet up with friends for more

Now we head back to Manhattan
We've picked up a friend or two
Maybe this morning we were strangers
But not by this afternoon
We hang until the sun comes up
End up on somebody's rooftop
Go to the Box and have a ball
At six or seven different clubs
And now I'm walking home through Chinatown
And I pass Chrystie street
Reminisce about the studio
Where The Knocks and we would meet
I know it changes, but of course

Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right

And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's COVID on the planes
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do
So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me ""forever,"" now you still can't call me back
And I love Vermont, but it's the seasons of the sticks

Free as these birds, light as whispers
Carolina knows
And you didn't see me here
No, they never did see me here

Into the mist, into the clouds
Don't leave
I make a fist, I'll make it count

And things that only Carolina will ever know
Carolina stains on the dress she left
Indelible scars, pivotal marks
Blue as the life she fled
Carolina pines, won't you cover me?
Hide me like robes down the back road
Muddy these webs we weave
And you didn't see me here
Oh, they never did see me

Into the mist, into the clouds

Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job, just makin' due
With tips in a jar, my guitar, and an old barstool

Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now

Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this
I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CD's just to give away
Payin' his dues
If I wasn't doin' this
Five deep in a van, head full of steam
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true
Livin' this life just like I was born to do

Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band

Were you counting stars?
Cause you packed your bags, had your heart set to roam
When you left for Georgia
Said your friends didn't want you
But I swear I do
Say what we are
Time's not a problem, do you think we were moving to fast?
Guess we weren't meant to last
I can't move on from that and
I don't have the words
So I'll keep counting stars

I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun

But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?
How long will it be cute, all this crying in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention
And someone else lights up the room? (Ahh)

You were napping on my arms on a Sunday afternoon
But, babe, I've gotta heal myself from the things I've never felt

A couple bad demos on a burned CD

First month's, last month's, two deposits
Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet
Thank God I was an optimist
I drove circles around this town

Tryna say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, got here but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this town
So many times, I thought about lеavin'
Got my ass kicked tryin' to compete with
Evеrybody else's ones that got away
Hung around long enough to catch a break
A couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked
Was the one about a car and the one about a church
That I wrote

Thérèse;Maya Hawke;Folk;https://open.spotify.com/track/1LklAGxyeK07JYRzw3Vzx9;"I go see Thérèse dreamin'
She's stretchin' out her sore shoulder
Leanin' back, eyes closed, reachin' up

Dreamin' of an Appaloosa
Saddled up, ridin' out of town
Dreamin' of a Shelby cobra
Diggin' her tires in the ground
Bleeding, bringing in a new year's mess
Unaware of the stain on her dress
It's tactless, it's a test
It's just Thérèse, it's just Thérèse
White kitten in the corner
Obscene, it really says it all
Milk matches her undеrwear
And get her down, takе her off the wall
She dreams of Marlon in Austin
Their bodies tangled in a net
She thinks of him every so often
When she feels like a space cadet
She empathizes with your feelings
She's more interested in ceilings

It's just Thérèse, it's just Thérèse
It's tactless, it's a test

Sleeping off the growing pains
We were sea anemones
Spelling out each other's names
Whispering inside our red house
While the adults were a-sleeping
I guess Thérèse was just for me
A quiet I keep on keeping
Thérèse does not belong to you
The horses, cars, and cowboys do

If you steal it, you're goin' to have to deal with the light when it's gone

Is chopping down the tree that I'm on
I think I need reflection, I think I'm getting colder
I don't want to think anymore
But it comes again no matter if I sing or think about it
In the end, it begins again all the way down

Connected energy, or how would I know
You were thinking of me in the dream?
The sweetness is around the seed
And I'm learning to keep going
Just an itty-bitty hit of weed
Got me ready to leave my body
And all of this could be arranged
We'd fly into the space between the lies we told
And find the good in every soul is all
Connected energy, or how would I know

A Good Love, Pt. 2;Bear's Den, Maisie Peters;Folk;https://open.spotify.com/track/7I2PEItnKfXLY4JTDYlSGY;"I'm sat in the corner, begging for water
Craving the sunlight, wishing that your eyes
Were looking to find mine, love is a battle
You fight for your whole life
Back in the day we were blossoming
A lot of delicate things we were promising
Now it's all eggshells and the nest upturned
I bury the feeling till it's covered in ferns
Now that all seems like a memory
Bruised and defeated falling leaves
I know for sure that we have a good love
I really hope that that is enough
Did you water those plants, babe
Out on the windowsill?
Please don't leave our love to wilt
Please don't take us for granted
We'll regret it if we don't have it
All I really know is that I miss us
Up against the wall, I'm in a free-fall
We had a good love, I don't know where I was
I know that I messed up, feel like I'm
Just trying to keep us all afloat
Now there's a new life blossoming
I worry about almost everything
That one day you'll wake up and see
This frightened fraud that I've always been
I don’t know what I should do
I can't do anything with all of my worries about you
I'm just trying my best to keep on top of all of the other stuff
It doesn’t mean anything without us
All the other stuff doesn’t mean anything without us
And I know that things are slipping
I will water those plants, babe
Out on the windowsill
I won't leave our love to wilt
I won’t take us for granted
We'll regret it if we don't have it

When the rain comes down on Babylon
The stone mason's phone rings all day long
And you gotta get back to the city

Cutting at the silent clay
A relief, beckon deep blue
Fettered in the magnet sun
Eat the gun as it feeds you
Spitting up the oxygen

Once again
Once again, empty horses
Gallop through the violet door
Follow red, crooked courses
Shadows on the moonlit floor
Oh, my stars, winged creatures
Gathering in silken height
Like the last human teachers

Crystal blood like a dream true
A ripple in the wound and wake

That you are the river of light
Who I love, that I cling to
In the belly of the empty night

Flicker, fever, fill the form
With a warm gush, now I wanna touch
Like we never could before
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms
And walk you to the shore
I remember building an energy shield
In your room, like a temple
Swallows in the windless field
Very thin, with your mother
Tall as a pale green tree
Very wild, bright as winter
Rising with a prism key
And a child to deliver
Taken with the blood and vine
As the first little angel
Little Andy, soft in your newborn skin
Only one, little Andy, will you return again?
I believe we can renew
And you could be my brother
Once again, fall asleep with our backs against each other
You believe, I believe too
That you are the river of light who I love

Have we forgot about the children? Forgot about love?
Have we forgot about forgiveness from the good Lord up above?

I been locked up all by myself but I'm known to grow my own
I burn it till it's gone like there ain't nothing wrong
I'm just out in the shade watching the world go up in flames

Line Of Fire;José González;Folk;https://open.spotify.com/track/2ET7YTxeo4tn7BlUGs3t4Y;"What would you do
If it all came back to you?
Each crest of each wave
Bright as lightning
What would you say
If you had to leave today?
Leave everything behind
Even though for once, you’re shining
You’re standing on higher ground
But when you hear the sound you realise it’s just the wind
And you notice it matters
Who and what you let under your skin
If put to the test
Would you step back from the line of fire?
Hold everything back
All emotions and desires
Convince yourself
To be someone else
And hide back from the world
Your lack of confidence
What you choose to believe in
Dictates your rise or your fall
Dictates your rise or your fall
With no one else around you
No one to understand you
No one to hear your calls
Look through all your dark corners
When you’re backed up against the wall
Step back from the line of fire

Step back from the line of fire
Step back from the line of fire";en;0.9999970677268186

The last time I put on my shoes
Go down to the corner
And buy the damn cat the expensive food

Early this morning, it started making sounds that say
""Don't the last time come too soon?
One down, eight to go, but it's no less true
Don't the last time come too soon?""
This may be the last time
Last time I get out of bed
Put coffee on and try, in your words
""To show some initiative""
We used to lay around here laughing
At what these freaks out there were trying to prove
Well, what's wasting time if not throwing it away on work
When the last time comes so soon?
Mr. Blue died in my arms, nothing they could do
Don't the last time come too soon?
Love's always gonna leave ya
No matter what they say
You only know what it is once it's gone away
This may be the last time
The last time I lay here with you
Do you swear it's not the cat?
You don't have to answer that
I'll just make do
But maybe if he'd gone sooner
Could've brought us back together last June
When the last time was our last time

Would've told you that the last time comes too soon
When the last time was our last time

What could I have said to raise you from the dead?

""Well, you do enough talk
My little hawk, why do you cry?
Tell me, what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?
Or the Fourth of July?
We're all gonna die""
Sitting at the bed with the halo at your head
Was it all a disguise, like junior high?
Where everything was fiction, future, and prediction
Now, where am I? My fading supply
""Did you get enough love, my little dove?
Why do you cry?
And I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best
Though it never felt right
My little Versailles""
The hospital asked, ""Should the body be cast?""
Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky
Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth
Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?
""Shall we look at the moon, my little loon?
Why do you cry?
Make the most of your life, while it is rife
While it is light

We had matching scars and matching tattoos
Both dyin' to fit in

We're just small town hypocrites
And that scholarship was a ship that sailed
When I chose you and daddy gave me hell
I made myself into someone else just to love you, damn, I loved you
Took all my plans and I put 'em in a box
Phantom pains for the wings I lost
Had me circling rings in the catalogs
For seven years, and you never got the hint
Ain't that some shit?

Swore we'd be running, running, running this town
But you're just running, running, running around
And I'm staring at a picket fence
Wonderin' where the hell time went
I should've been running, running, running by now
But I just hang around
Love shot me out like a rocket
Never to return, and man, I forgot it
How it feels to fall from orbit and land on shifting sands
I found my heart at the bottom of a bucket
You said you needed space, and damnit, I bought it
'Til you moved in a vinyl-sided double-wide with a couple of her kids

Was it love that we shared when we easily cared?
Now it's impossible to conceive
I don't know who can see you
If you've ever learned how to let someone in
Well, I've tried to comе find you
But I just don't know where to begin
If you'vе ever been open, there's no way of knowin'
With the way that knowin' you has been
Was it always so broken?
If these thoughts were spoken
Would it bring us together again?

I can't tell you I'm trying when there's nothing left here to try for
Well, I can't be the one to keep holding you back
If there's somethin' you're missin', then go right ahead
I'll be long gone, thanks for the songs
Guess it's time to wake up from this trip we've been on
So long, farewell, this is the end
And I'll always remember you just like a friend
And the way that you said, as heavy as lead
""You've always known how to get straight to my head""

Pretty soon, he'll tease her

My laboured love bore only song
And not one of them a keeper

I know I'd try and find the will to be strong
But am I strong еnough?
Am I strong enough?
I once built a bower, I could build you a home
Together forever, but forever and on is still not long enough
It's still not long enough
The look of fear was in your eyes
And I could see myself as a child
Such a devastating feeling
I wished I could go back in time
But all I could do was apologize
Right then, your eyes were healing

Been a drunken fool

Let's say you give me one more time
One last chance to speak again
Let's start from what we left unsaid
And here we go
Brave enough to go climbing a wall
So high that no sunlight is seen through winter
Brave enough to go traveling around the world
Without money to eat or sleep for
Seeing what you can do with your hands and feet
I feel there is no question about it
Almost anything you can imagine
Almost any goal, you will get there
I wish you had been more of a talker
Not the kind that is just flapping his lips
And not the kind that looks away
But learns through his eyes when somеbody is watching
Maybe you could have told me
Thеre was a world on your shoulders that needed lifting
Maybe I could have helped you with that
The weight is not easy I know
But you never know
I thought your shoes were good
I thought they would take you to the end of any road
I thought your back was strong
But I should have carried you to the top of the rocky trail
(Carried you to the top of the rocky trail)

Into the pits of imaginary slumps
With my new kicks that I never picked
I need all the heart I can get from my

And every now and then so far

A little more sure of his ways

Ten years time and a wiser mind
It seems his world has changed
Knowing somehow what I didn’t know then
Would I still have done it the same

Though I fall asleep, I never fall back
Took a ride to our friend's house
Named forty-second street the day I burned it down
Just started running like a hurricane
Next thing I know we're at the fast train
One that never works, the second it starts raining
If you're bored, you should say it now
Before the sky turns gray and we're left underground
We'll have to dig a tunnel to escape
Oh, my love, just started running like a hurricane
Who'll wake you up in the middle of the night?
Make you laugh, make you cry, make you think about your whole life
Nobody here got that magic anymore
I got lines, I got jokes, I got time enough to tell it all
I think it's alright, I think it's okay
You make my heart beat like a hurricane
Like a hurricane
We hit the coast, sun it goes down
Thinking of the dead, they never stick around
No parade, there's no crying out
It's just these neon signs, paper thrown around
Make it hardest coming out the gate
But then you say all we need is car suspension
A little money and our pretension
Maybe someone to live for, maybe someone to mention how
How we look so much better, when light, it turns gold
While the night is here, we celebrate
Oh my love, you got me running like a hurricane
Who'll wake you up in the middle of the night?
Make you laugh, make you cry, make you think about your whole life
Nobody here got that magic anymore
I got lines, I got jokes, I got time enough to tell it all

And I remember feeling the same way
All around me these fell slowly
These overclocks, they started changing shape
Just love me, it's okay

So why does it feel like I'm under the gun?
When the war's already won
Forgotten my own mother tongue, followin' the wanderlust
The promise [?] is always harder [?]

Trees pinker than flamingos

Well, I guess we shared October skies
As I said good day and you said goodnight
In my wildest dreams you'll be with me
In Montreal and the falling leaves
Take flight light as a feather
So drift to me, darling, drift to me
To Montreal and the falling leaves
And we’ll be light thеre together, wе'll be light there together

Those fabled oranges from China
And I nearly burnt my eyebrows off
With that hot sauce from that diner

In Montreal and the falling leaves

To Montreal and the falling leaves
We'll be light there together, we'll be light there together
Take flight light as a feather
'Cause oh, you would've loved it there
Better than a video call (Better than a video call)
And oh, I wish that we could share
Our favorite moments, don't we all?

You'll find me in the dark

Challenged to steer our collective destiny

How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
(Great John on the beat by the way)
And I don't wanna die-I don't-I don't wanna die young and—
Ayy, I don't wanna die young, so I stay with a stick
Still on that shit, fuck two times six
Forgot who I was, let me talk my shit, like
Sturdiana, buss a move when I get up behind ya
Shorty bad, she get it from her mama
I do what I do and she do what she wanna
That's a fact and no cap
Me and Sheff had to run up them racks
If you miss then we doublin' back
2018, I was stuck in the trap
Fell in love and I got too attached
Heart got broke, it ain't no comin' back
If we up it, ain't no comin' back
Fuck with my opps, said they no comin' back
Is you with it?, If you up it, I up it, let's get it
Sleepy ain't feel no love in a minute
But, fuck it 'cause I ain't been broke in a minute
And your bitch hit me up said she just wanna fuck
'Cause she ain't feel the strokes in a minute
You know me, I be hittin' it different
So you can't get it back when I'm finished
So you can't get it—
When l'm cookin,' l'm not in the kitchen
I'm probably somewhere outta town doing business
So, I'm sorry if I couldn't kick it
I got attached, so I had to go missin'
Said she love me that's part of my mission
Niggas be fake, gotta keep 'em a distance
Baby stop all that trippin', you should just listen
Three words, my body different
So I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy (Ayy)
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die-I don't-I don't wanna die young and—
I don't wanna die young that might make mama crazy
No ocean I'm too wavy
No therapy could save me
Took L's been winnin' lately
Locked in ain't no escapin'
Sometimes I get impatient
Mask on, no face no, cases, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fall back, baby I gotta breathe
Fear nobody, I'm ready to bleed
And she for the streets, she not for me
From a place where they never believe
In the hood, thought I never would leave
Like, what would you do if you run into me?
Grab the choppa and you better squeeze
Had no knock as he bob and he weave
If I go better follow my lead
I still make it hot, like a hunnid degrees
Show no love 'cause it's hard to receive
You seen what I seen then you'd probably agree
Cops and robbers, I'm playin' the thief
And mama told me not to play in these streets
It's too late 'cause l'm playin' for keeps
So I'm lookin' through my memories, fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you? You're really just my enemy (I don't wanna die young)

Ain't matching my fly, bitch, you know you a dub

Stopped taking molly, I'm back on the E
Flying commercial, you ain't high as me
Driving a spaceship, the one with the wings
Cross up the trap, I done broke down a key
Ain't let no fuck nigga holdin' me back
Put a switch on it, these lil' niggas whack

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen
I'm from the four, but I love me a threesome
DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out ""YOLO,"" yeah, that's still the motto
I know I be on some shit that they ain't thought of
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time

Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?
I been makin' like two thousand a minute
So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished
Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag

And we might have a child when I'm finished
They say I'm Pac rebirth, never put out a weak verse
Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought
Uh, copped a BMW, new deposit, I picked up another bag

I did everything I said I would, and said it first
I mean the world's in denial, but they all know what I'm headed for
Ah
We 'bout to feed these youngins to the metaverse
Meanwhile I'm over here just tryna pen a verse
'Cause I'm done bein' extra with the extroverts
The label used to wonder how I'm supposed to stand next to Vert
Prolly never thought that I would get these legs to work
I work hard, but hard shit don't need no extra work
That's why I show up in a sweatshirt and let it burn
The world's mine, I just say, ""Fuck it, let it turn""
The girl's mine, I just say, ""Fuck it, have a turn""
The G.O.A.T.s call me to the side like, ""Can we have a word?""
I could've fronted but I did this shit how I preferred (I preferred)
Mmm, I know I should be humble, but it's somethin' I just haven't learned
Soon enough I have to make these bad habits burn
Soon enough we 'bout to come and get the shit we earn
You not a fan now, but I remember when you used to be fanned out
I'm guessin' when the whole world loves you, people only got one way to stand out
All that time in the kitchen finally panned out
I put some flavor in a pot and took the bland out
I know my grandpa would have a heart attack if I pulled a hunnid grand out
So I'm not gonna pull a hunnid grand out
I'm hip-hop, do you fully understand?
Fully automatic with the jams and they don't jam
At the shows I'm 'bout to start handin' out programs
'Cause y'all need to get with the program
I'm a grown-ass man, call me pops
Fuck around and take your phone ass man
Everybody know Jack, but they don't know Jack, man
They just know I got the flows and the hoes and the packed out shows
Ain't too many cons when you playin' with the pros
'Cept for how your life get exposed, but I make that sacrifice for the life that I chose
I know in Toronto they got salt for the roads
But schools closed in Kentucky, so I like when it snowed
The kids carry chopsticks not for rice in the bowl
School counselors all know how they life is at home
Cold like the Minnesota Vikings at home
Before I met Drizzy, I knew he and I would get along
But it's hard to crack jokes when you really want advice
I mean, what's it like to touch gold every time you touch a mic? Touchin' heights, no one gets a touch in life
Fuckin' right, young bachelor, what's a wife?
Once in a lifetime, 'til I say I want it twice
One of a kind, know your everything is one of mine
Wanted posters with my face, they know who I'm wanted by
Yeah
Yeah
Cold hearts and heated floors
No parental guidance, I just see divorce
Therapy sessions, I'm in the waiting room, readin' Forbes
Abandonment issues I'm gettin' treated for
How much water can I fit under the bridge before it overflows?
My son's gotta learn that forgiveness is a lonely road
The cribs on his will like motor homes
Niggas love to try and test us like they know what we on
Chubb's got the magazine cover like Rolling Stone
'Cause we already know how they rock, they throwin' stones
Whenever you gettin' bigger, there's growin' pains
I got enough pull to make the city start throwin' games
I'm out here makin' a mockery
I got my realtor out here playin' Monopoly
How can I address you when you don't own property?
They only finesse you when you don't move properly
Destined for the win, but you don't get a prize out of me
I'm destined for the top, but you can't get a rise out of me
Seven-fifty for the round canaries, and they glitterin'
Man, you niggas drop trash, you litterin'
I'm overdeliverin' to the point, it's belittlin'
I mean, the PTSD is triggerin'
The profit is sickenin', the stones is shimmerin'
Came from the north, but
I got hot as fuck, so ain't no shiverin', yeah
Lucky me, people that don't fuck with me
Are linkin' up with people that don't fuck with me to fuck with me
This shit is gettin' ugly
And every situation is transactional
And every thing they sayin' is irrational
And every way they movin' is promotional
Everybody's actin' irreplaceable, it's like they ain't disposable
My urges for revenge are uncontrollable
I know we're gettin' older though, yeah
But I gotta get a nigga back for that, it's non-negotiable
It's not even debatable
I'm gettin' so rich, my music's not even relatable
I blow her head up, it's an inflatable
Baby blue G class, I feel like a kid again
Prayin' on my downfall don't make you religious, man
All I hear is plug talk comin' from middleman
All I hear is tall tales comin' from little men
When I say ""Bitch,"" I'm very rarely referrin' to women
Most of the bitches I know are niggas, they not even women
I know that sounds like I'm bein' funny, I'm not even kidding
Same ones that say they run the game when they not even in it
To be honest, y'all financial situation's my biggest motivation
And how you should take that statement is based on what you makin'
Whips and chains like a dominatrix, wap, pssh
If I see ya, I spit in ya faces, ha-tu
Daytonas with the green faces
Kentucky derby races, my presence in the spot is so abrasive
Box at the Churchill Downs, that's motivation, yeah

Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe

Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta

Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that

I've been goin' through somethin'
One-thousand eight-hundred and fifty-five days
I've been goin' through somethin'
Be afraid
What is a bitch in a miniskirt?
A man in his feelings with bitter nerve
What is a woman that really hurt?
A demon, you're better off killing her
What is a relative making repetitive narratives
On how you did it first?
That is a predator, hit reverse
All of your presidents' evil thirst
What is a neighborhood rep'table?
That is a snitch on a pedestal
What is a house with a better view?
A family broken in variables
What is a rapper with jewelry?
A way that I show my maturity
What if I call on security?
That mean I'm calling on God for purity
I went and got me a therapist
I can debate on my theories and sharing it (Woah)
Consolidate all my comparisons
Humblin' up because time was imperative (Woah)
Started to feel like it's only one answer
To everything, I don't know where it is (Woah)
Popping a bottle of Claritin (Woah)
Is it my head or my arrogance? (Woah)
Shaking and moving, like, what am I doing?
I'm flipping my time through the Rolodex
Indulging myself and my life and my music
The world that I'm in is a cul-de-sac
The world that we in is just menacing
The demons portrayed as religionous
I wake in the morning, another appointment
I hope the psychologist listenin'
The new Mercedes with black G-Wagon
The ""Where you from?"", it was all for rap
I was 28 years young, twenty mill' in tax
Bought a couple of mansions, just for practice
Five hundred in jewelry, chain was magic
Never had it in public, late reaction
50K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive
I grieve different
I grieve different (Huh)
I met her on the third night of Chicago
North America tour, my enclave
Fee-fi-fo-fum, she was a model
Dedicated to the songs I wrote and the Bible
Eyes like green penetratin' the moonlight
Hair done in a bun, energy in the room like
Big Bang for theory, God, hopin' you hear me
Phone off the ringer, tell the world, ""I'm busy""
Fair enough, green eyes said her mother didn't care enough
Sympathize when her daddy in the chain gang
Her first brother got killed, he was twenty-one
I was nine when they put Lamont in the grave
Heartbroken when Estelle didn't say goodbye
Chad left his body after we FaceTimed
Green eyes said you'd be okay, first tour, sex the pain away
I grieve different
I grieve different (Huh)

So what, paralyzed, the county building controlled us
I bought a Rolex watch, I only wore it once
I bought infinity pools I never swimmed in
I watched Keem buy four cars in four months
You know the family dynamics on repeat
The insecurities locked down on PC
I bought a .223, nobody peace treat
You won't doo-doo me, I smell TNT
Dave got him a Porsche, so I got me a Porsche
Paid lottery for it, I ain't want it in portions

But the money wipin' the tears away

Last time you told me you proud of me, you wasn't proud of me, you was the nigga who doubted me
I was too mad at you, you let 'em come kill you, my brother, that shit was a tragedy
But magically, I got the strategy, I was so sick and tired of niggas keep asking me
""Who was the killers between the hood?"" (DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)
Bro, I'm a king, that mean we good
Talked to my tete about my problems
Learned to survive, I carry my chopper
Before I was twelve, I went to the doctor
Fucked on a stripper and I took me a Roxy
How you my blood and you say you gon' pop me?
Fall over loyalty, never 'bout thotties
Don't mention my name if you mentionin' bodies
Don't mention my name if you mentionin' bodies
Stopped taking drugs, had to sit in a sauna
How you gon' blame me? I gave her Gabbana
Bitch, I'm a star, gotta use condom
Don't drink Par, only like Wocka
Sippin' on Wocka, I feel like I'm Flocka
Shit in my pocket, that shit'll go blocka
Say that I'm mean, what you mean? I caught you
Get away from her, high speed, no tossin'
Called you a bitch, I'm sorry I lost you
Head down, X pill, Percocet, off it
Bitch, my phone died, pass me a charger
Ain't have a coat, walked to school in a thermal
Bitches you lookin' up to, they'll burn you
Get out my business, that shit don't concern you
I get to diggin' this shit when I learn you
I love the trenches, this shit is eternal
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
I wish my brother had made it out surgery
I be up thinkin', that shit do be hurtin' me
If they gon' catch me, them niggas gon' murder me (Oh no, oh)
Gave my bro twenty, he caught for a burglary
I love the bitches who say they ain't heard of me
Ever seen blood? That shit'll turn burgundy
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
Oh my God, what happened to Virgil?
Fresh like the first day of school, I'm a scholar
Found the solution and got some more problems
We from the sandbox, my dawg since a toddler
Sixteen years old when I shot my first chopper
Flew out of Van Nuys, landed in Opa-locka
Quit flyin' in G5, fly helicopters (Fly helicopters)
I count every blessin', they count every dollar
I'm 'bout to go factory plain
I treat all of my dawgs the same
Take care all of my bitches the same
I just hope you financially sane
Never turning my back on the gang
From the A, we was taught to be brave
Had to squabble and take a few fades
Stay rock solid, you'll get through the phase
Damn my nigga, what happened to Virgil?
Talked to God, I don't wanna get murdered
I got style, I don't know what you heard of

Reach out to Eckhart
I come from a generation of home invasions and I got daddy issues, that's on me
Everything them four walls had taught me, made habits bury deep
That man knew a lot, but not enough to keep me past them streets
My life is a plot, twisted from directions that I can't see
Daddy issues ball across my head, told me, ""Fuck a foul""
I'm teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won't think out loud
A foolish pride, if I lose again, won't go in the house
I stayed outside, laughin' with my friends, they don't know my lifе
Daddy issues made me lеarn losses, I don't take those well
Momma said, ""That boy is exhausted,"" he said, ""Go fuck yourself
If he give up now, that's gon' cost him, life's a bitch
You could be a bitch or step out the margin,"" I got up quick
I'm chargin' baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance
Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent
Oh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice
Tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues

Tough love (Ah), bottled up, no chaser (Ah)

Neat, no chaser (Ah), neat, no chaser (Ah)

I got daddy issues, that's on me
Lookin' for, ""I love you,"" rarely empathizin' for my relief
A child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee
'Cause if I cried about it, he'd surely tell me not to be weak
Daddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself
Men should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped
His momma died, I asked him why he goin' back to work so soon?
His first reply was, ""Son, that's life, the bills got no silver spoon""
Daddy issues, fuck everybody, go get your money, son
Protect yourself, trust nobody, only your momma'n'em
This made relationships seem cloudy, never attached to none
So if you took some likings around me, I might reject the love
Daddy issues kept me competitive, that's a fact, nigga
I don't give a fuck what's the narrative, I am that nigga
When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused
Guess I'm not mature as I think, got some healin' to do
Egotistic, zero-given fucks and to be specific (Ah)
Need assistance with the way I was brought up (Ah, ah)
What's the difference when your heart is made of stone
And your mind is made of gold
And your tongue is made of sword, but it may weaken your soul?
My niggas ain't got no daddy, grow up overcompensatin'
Learn shit 'bout bein' a man and disguise it as bein' gangsta
I love my father for tellin' me to take off the gloves
'Cause everything he didn't want was everything I was
And to my partners that figured it out without a father
I salute you, may your blessings be neutral to your toddlers
It's crucial, they can't stop us if we see the mistakes
'Til then, let's give the women a break, grown men with daddy issues

But God gotta know he might have peaked when he made you
The cosmos' only mistake is what they named you (What that mean?)
They should call you sugar, you're so sweet
Well, they should call you sugar, 'cause you're so sweet to me
Well, they should call you sugar, sugar, oh, you're so sweet
'Cause, baby, you're the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest thing I've known
Baby, you're the sweetest thing
Even if
You left me out here stranded, my feelings wouldn't change a bit (You know how I feel about you, are you ready?)
You know how I feel, baby
Infinite
The love I have for you, a diamond couldn't put a dent in it (Uh, go to the bridge thing, okay)
Darling, you're the wind under my wings
My heart beats triple time when I see you
Somethin' I can't control
If I compared you, the sun is a stand-in (Sun)
You got a smile that could light up a planet (Smile), yeah (Oh, oh)
And I just wanted you to know (They should call you sugar)
They should call you sugar, you're so sweet
Well, they should call you sugar (Why?), 'cause you're so sweet to me (Sugar)
Well, they should call you sugar (Sugar), you're so sweet (Oh, oh)
'Cause, baby, you're the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest thing I've known (Ooh, girl)
You're the sweetest
They should call you sugar, you're so sweet (Sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar)
Well, they should call you sugar (Why?), 'cause you're so sweet to me
Well, they should call you sugar, you're so sweet (You're so sweet to me)
'Cause, baby, you're the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest (I know)
And you look so good (Yeah)
And you smell so good (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you taste so good (Yeah)
And you're so, so good (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're the sweetest (Yeah)
Yeah, you are, ha-ha
Sweet like, like motherfuckin' brown sugar sweet potatoes (Are you ready?)

But my energy belongs to you
I want you so bad, but not too fast
It's not your fault, we can't pretend
Because we both in the wrong
So what makes you think

How could you know, know, know

I thought you wanted to dance
I wish that we never met, I wish that we ain't connect
Like Lego, connection good, but mixed signal
If you say so, like cardio
We stared up and down, but we didn't blink
Felt like dirty dishes 'cause we was in sync
I swear to God, if you and him never linked
I'd tear that ass up like somethin' was stole
I'd make them glass balls roll back to your skull
Call a tail number, where you wanna go?
The fuck do he got that I don't got a lot of?
There go my ego again, that's the problem
The fuck you expect? I go get what I want
I want you to say you pick me with your voice
I'm twenty-five up, but I can't buy your choice
You're priceless to me, but that's not the point
You got me out here smokin' joints
You got me out here losin' point
I'm cancellin' shoots and I'm cancellin'—
I'm hitchhiking, you pull over, so invitin'
The seat got my name on it, but who driving?
He hiatus, we spend time, and we repeat and we rewind it
Your headlights? It hit my eyelid
Love is blinding, y'all together? Don't remind me, so confusin'
What we doing? How y'all doing?
Oh, you choosin' him? Okay, I gotta cope with losing, fuck
I ain't been sleepin' well
Twin, I'll never tell
Stay busy so I don't think, 'cause downtime is when it sink in
I stare at old pictures, I, I thought you wanted to dance (Dance)
I thought you wanted to dance, I
Maybe, maybe (For you)
What's the chance, though?
I wish that we had better timing
I'll save a dance just for you

Count Me Out;Kendrick Lamar;Hip Hop;https://open.spotify.com/track/6BU1RZexmvJcBjgagVVt3M;"We may not know which way to go on this dark road
(Mr. Duckworth)
All of these hoes make it difficult
Session 10, breakthrough
One of these lives, I'ma make things right
With the wrongs I've done, that's when I unite
With the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight
Rain on me, put the blame on me
Got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
Got six magazines that's aimed at me
Done every magazine, what's fame to me?
(And I'm tripping and falling)
It's a game to me, where the bedroom at?
Sleep, I ain't nevеr had affairs with that
What's fair when the hearts and thе words don't reach?
What's fair when the money don't take things back?
It's rare when somebody take your dreams back
(And I'm tripping and falling)
I care too much, wanna share too much, in my head too much
I shut down too, I ain't there too much
I'm a complex soul, they layered me up
Then broke me down, and morality's dust, I lack in trust
(And I'm tripping and falling)
This time around, I trust myself
Please everybody else but myself
All else fails, I was myself
Outdone fear, outdone myself
This year, you better one yourself
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Masks on the babies, mask on an opp
Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
But a mask won't hide who you are inside
Look around, the reality's carved in lies
Wipe my ego, dodge my pride
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Look myself in the mirror
Amityville, ain't seen nothin' scarier
I fought like a pitbull terrier
Blood I shed could fill up aquariums
Tell all my angels, ""Carry 'em""
(And I'm tripping and falling)
Every emotion been deprived
Even my strong points couldn't survive
If I didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg
I love when you count me out (Huh)
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
(Wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)
I love when you count me out
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up
How you gon' win my trust when the lies run deep? (Wah, woo, wah)
How you gon' bend your love when the bad don't sleep? (Sheesh)
Beep, beep, crash our feelings in the middle of the street (Vroom, vroom)
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up (Huh, huh)
When you was at your lowest, tell me where the hoes was at?
When you was at your lowest, tell me where the bros was at?
Three-thirty in the mornin', scroll through the call log (Huh, huh, huh, huh)
Ain't nobody but the mirror lookin' for the fall off (Brrrt)
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out
(Wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)
My name is in your mouth, shoo, shoo
It's gon' take more than pride to stop me
Call 9-1-1, I caught a body
Sun up now, and yesterday is fadin'
Healing's only 'bout a mile away
Let me tell you 'bout the woman I know (That's my baby)
I know karma like to follow us strong (Sheesh)
I know millionaires that feel alone (Sheesh)
Anytime I couldn't find God, I still could find myself through a song
Many find they life in a phone
Fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuck it up, fuckin' it up
You said I'd feel better if I just worked hard without liftin' my head up
That left me fed up
You made me worry
I wanted my best version, but you ignored me
Then changed the story, then changed the story
Good energy in the room, drop the location, please
Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated, please
(Antibiotic for the womb when I'm frustrated)
Tryna keep my good conscience in rotation
Thoughts in my head, they livin' there with no— (Tryna keep my good)
I made a decision, never give you my feelings
Fuck with you from, fuck with you from a distance
Some put it on the Devil when they fall short
I put it on my ego, lord of all lords
Sometimes I fall for her, dawg
I love when you count me out
I love when you count me out (Sheesh)
I love when you count me out (Sheesh)
I love when you count me out (Wah, woo, wah, woo, wah)
My name is in your mouth

Miss Regrets, can you please exit out my home? (Miss Regrets)
Miss Regret, I think I'm better off alone (Miss Regrets)

Understand;BoyWithUke;Hip Hop;https://open.spotify.com/track/6dGqGkYDoRrKh5UiIcTT22;"Girl, I hope you understand, I wanted to hold your hand
But I can't, wanted to be your man back then
And you knew I fell for you, but you just broke my heart in two
I was sad, mad, and broken on my bed
Hoping I get rid of all the voices in my head
I was opening a packet of an undeveloped med
When I was met with a prescription of a bullet made of lead
And when I woke up in an hour in a pool of my own sweat
I said, ""I swear to God I'll never even try to sleep again""
So instead, I took my pen and started writing evidence
And whеn I started making sense, I found that I had rеached the end
Oh, I'm upset, I have no friends, you wanna bet, you're just pretend?
You're just a pet confined within the lines of writing, you're not shit
I thought I stopped my psychopathic ways, I swear I did
I said I'd talk to people 'bout the problematic life I lived
They were my neighbors; razor blades
And different flavored pills I hit
Therefore, I'm at, surely, my last straw
I'm so gassed, stuck in the past, I said that
Girl, I hope you understand, I wanted to hold your hand
But I can't, wanted to be your man back then
And so far I never held you with my arms
So it's hard to be the one you aren't with
Instead filled with anxiety, always was a part of me
Guess I'm not cut out to be
Somebody 'cause it's not me, I'm not used to all the talking
Was an introvert that had converted feelings into writing
Used to cope with all my problems using notes and lots of rhyming
Used to hope for better days whenever nights would have me crying
I'm not lying when I say that I would rather die than go back
To the times I would try and be the guy the people know
As always fighting with the demons hiding far behind my eyelids
On an island full of violence, in my head I had two pilots
Oh, the sun don't shine and skies turn grey
I feel it coursing through my veins
I've said before I'm not okay
But you don't listen anyway
You know I tried, you turned away
You straight-up lied right to my face
You fucked my life, ruined my day
But you don't know, so I'll say
Nothing can fill this silence, no one can love like I did
(You don't know, so I'll say)
Nobody cares, you lied, it's not fair, you still deny it
(So I'll say)
Nothing can fill this silence, no one can love like I did
(You don't know, so I'll say)
Nobody cares, you lied, it's not fair, you still deny it
(So I'll say)
Girl, I hope you understand, I wanted to hold your hand
But I can't, wanted to be your man back then
And too bad I know I can't wake up because I lost my way
And you don't give a fuck about me, this could be a dream
I can't see the things that you see, so please, oh
Girl, I hope you understand, I wanted to hold your hand
But I can't, wanted to be your man back then
And you had known and played along

Sitting behind five percent, you can see the chinain
Lil' one going crazy, ready to sprrt for the ginang
If it wasn’t for Google, man that bitch wouldn't know my nickname
Dropped a Maybach truck on a watch and it was plain jane
Let the door swang, swang the door open, smell cocaine
Trafficking drug money and trap out this one lane
Stepped all in mud, this bitch can't wait to tie my shoelace
Oh, she don’t like girls, bet this money make a bitch so gay
Money real long, big as King Kong when you make the trap go jump
Yellow wrist stones, canary yellow stones, I'm putting on that stuff
Digging in hеr back, pull out my money, make a bitch bust a nut
Came out thе bando just to buy diapers, had to hit me a lick
I bought the Tahoe from the trap money, haven't even seen a brick
Cocaine by the kilo, these days put it right on my wrist
You can still see the chain lit up sitting behind five percent
Every time I re-up, they gotta advance at least twenty M
I been getting richer and richer my whole career
Took the dope money, went and record a mixtape, it's rappers way out
Sitting on a bail toting a big K, ain't even got a couch
To Australia, I'm familiar, spent two million on a jet
In that dualie doing the dash, I let lil' dawg he hold a TEC
I got molly with the crystals, but I been back doing X
Got a Rolex on my wrist, this bitch cost 'bout a Corvette
Give these niggas a couple bands and hit your face and hit your chest
I was rolling off the pill, I should’ve never fucked the bitch
I got hoes these niggas married, I don’t let 'em go, they come through
I got fentanyl in my diamonds, I spend a nine on a pair of shoes
I don’t even care who these niggas shot at, ain't nan of 'em got murked
I got some real killers, they'll kill a nigga, then go and shoot up the hearse
You think a nigga like me give a fuck ’bout a nigga shooting up the church?
I gotta take this shit up with God 'cause I'm a god on the earth
I got this motherfuckin' new Benz, I ain't even drove it since it came out
Couple of bad bitches, they twins, walkin' naked through my house
Cook good dope up in the kitchen, I could do that top chef
Bitches still claiming me, I ain't fucked in over a year
Cartier wrist, Cartier watch, Cartier diamond buff
Money real long, big as King Kong when you make the trap go jump
Yellow wrist stones, canary yellow stones, I'm putting on that stuff

Putting rap on my back and I'm black and snatchin' crowns
I done came back around like a nigga sellin' crack in pounds
I got a bag now but it's nothing to brag 'bout
Gun blast in the background
I'm a black man with the bloodhounds
MAC-10, making love sounds
To a bad chick, she from Uptown
I'm from down South, not a loudmouth
We can fuck around (Woah, shit, woah)
Hit the music, baby, cut it down (Woah, shit, woah)
Hit a doobie while you do me indubitably

I'm at the top where I'm 'posed to be
Jumped in the game, niggas act like they coaching me
Four hundred racks ain't shit but a show to me
I'm on the road and I bet that your ho with me
When I'm in traffic, it's always a pole wit' me
Pillsbury man, I keep dough with me
Hit from the back
She giving me slurp and I ain't even pull my pants down
Jump in the box and slide to the other side, it's always a man down
Draw down, hands in the air, nigga
Make one move, get gunned down
Giving out smoke so long
They don't even wanna talk no more, they just run now
No locked doors, I serve with a chop
Bitch got spent, she was hanging with an opp
We call him Mickey, he talks to the cops
I was on Pinedale, glass in the sock
Back in the day, I invest in the block
Fast forward, now I'm investing in stocks

Don't play 'cause I'm very invested in shots

Press stop, fuck a top-five list
Get ‘em a vest, he get lopsided

Robbin' niggas in the hood and then swap genres
Green light, line a nigga up, stop sign him
Keep drivin', you will not find him
I'm a, I'm a, I'm an-I'm an anomaly, I turned into a rapper ironically
And ran the bag up, back up, niggas is onto me

Treat the rappin' like I'm pushin' rock
On the stove with the Pyrex pot

I been hot since the birth of my son
I remain unfazed, trust, worse has been done
Man, fuck a valuation, show me personal funds
It's the pretty boys versus the petty boys
Sold that already, got a whole new set of toys
Shit is so surreal, Drizzy Drake, you better enjoy it
Nothing else bigger than the OVO letterman boys
Cashmere knits for the nighttime boat rides
Ollie got the first еdition parked up roadside
The only sign of strugglin' is coming from thosе guys
I'm tryna just relay what I can see through my own eyes
And nothin' tell the truth like the eyes will
Lived so much for others don't remember how I feel
Friends in high places and friends that are hostile
Still managed to moonwalk straight through a minefield
And then I'll come back to tell you how that feels
Built this house for us all, pain in my back still
You niggas gassed up, you couldn't pay the

Under her picture lives some of the greatest quotes from me
Under me, I see all the people that claim they over me
And above me, I see nobody
I'd have to be dead for them to say that you took it from me
The twenty percent of you that we own is my tootsie's money
Nigga, I'm wilding with your bread, you owe it to me
CJ grab racks out the bag and throw it to me
They don't want a problem with the boy, but it's goin' to be
Trust in my brothers is as strong as I know it should be
Future sign the contracts, he don't even show it to me
I don't have to second-guess nothing with no one I love
'Bout to build a second guest house 'cause we growing too much
Think I got to scale the love back 'cause
I need you, I need you, I need you
I need to make you see
What you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean
Yeah, oh
Heavy day
For real
Yeah
Yeah
The city's on fire and people are in denial
Charges being laid, but we'll see what they do at trial
I'm calling this shit from now
Sweetheart deals that the judges been handing down
I haven't been able to see family for a while
That shit is wearin' me out
I used to hide my pain in Delilah behind the bar 'til my niggas carried me out
And if money's all I need in my grave, then bury me now
I know I tend to talk about how I got a fortune on me
But with that comes the politics the city been forcing on me
Man, I can't even R.I.P. and show my remorse to the homie
Know I carry the guilt of the city's misfortunes on me
I even got the cleanin' staff plotting extortion on me
My parents' divorce is on me
My therapist's voice is making the choices for me
And I always censor myself 'cause no matter what, they reporting on me
The pressure is weighin' on me
Career is going great, but now the rest of me's fading slowly
My soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me
My chef got the recipe for disaster baking slowly
My heart feel vacant and lonely, but still
I'm makin' the most of this shit and more
Every single move is like rolling dice on the board
Seen too many brothers get twenty-five from the boys
I'd rather see all of 'em get twenty-five from the Lord
And if the last negotiation made you pay me twenty-five
Well, this is the perfect time to give me twenty-five more
I'm bigger now than before
Co-parent of the year, we figured out a rapport
No fair what Drizzy made on the second leg of the tour
How could anybody tell you the truth when they misinformed?
How the niggas turnin' up with you turned you in for rewards?
How the **** do we manage to win everything but awards?
**** windows of opportunity, let me go through the doors
This the part where I don't ever say ""Pardon me"" anymore
This the part where I'ma find a new part of me to explore
This the part where all my partners know what we in it for
This the part where we gon' throw us a party after the war
And if the last negotiation had you feeling out of pocket
Well, this is the perfect time that I empty them shits for sure

Let's say, bad things were done to you when you were a child. And you develop a sense of self that is based on the bad things that happened to you
You ever seen your mama strung out while you studied division?
Your uncle ever stole from you, day after Christmas?
Seen both of those in the county jail visits
The first and the fifteenth, the only religion
Noodles in the microwave, shark tank tidal wave
Grandma shootin' niggas, blood on the highway
Crossеs on the dashboard, you just want a platform
I wanna take evеrything that I ask for
Catch me a body, I'll put that on anybody but my mama
She showin' a pattern for certain
I think it's white panties and minimal condoms
My uncle would tell me the shit in the movies could only be magic
This year, I did forty-three shows and took it all home to buy him a casket
Jack of all trades, got money out the way
Put my heart in the faith, I'm good, love
Cousin in the courts, heard he jumped off the porch
Turn a brick to a Porsche, I'm good, love
Catch us, you know I'm gon' rack up
I need the advance and the equity to match up
The engineer dead if the drive don't back up
These words come of God, you could never outrap us
Nowadays, gotta walk cautious, ayy
Nowadays, I'm a new prophet, ayy
Game dead, no autopsy,  ayy
City girl with they new hobby, ayy
Catch a body, put the Prada in the ta-da
Nigga 'boutta get some pussy, give me five (Give me five)
Gun dirty, got the thirty in the purse, purse
Tight bitch, put a perky in her salad

I never seen my niggas bust down faces
Them niggas not tasteless
I only had one chance, I ain't even waste it
Been down on my luck
Been down on my luck when I fa-a-all
I gotta get up
I gotta get back up and ba-a-a-all
R-I-P, under my people
I'm proud of my people, I'm proud of my dawgs
My ex got a beamer, she want me to see it
I still ain't gon' see it, like, okay
I love when they ratchet, I don't do her Patek
I still do the watches the old way
She think I'm conceited, I'm thinkin' 'bout cheatin'
I don't do the flowers or roleplay
Now, how can I fold lookin' at twenty million
This money don't come with a probate
Mama, I said it'd be okay
I got this shit brackin' in four days
Four eyes, four eyes, two eyes
Switch sides, nigga be fresh out
Suicide doors, I suicide, suicide

How forward of me would it be to tell you to forward to me
You should be right here anyways

When the liquor hit, then a bitch get toxic
(Why the fuck you in the club when niggas wildin’?)
I've been lit since brunch, thot shit
Order '42 for the table, let’s pop shit
Missionary or doggystyle, I'ma top shit
Pussy-ass niggas hatin' on me from the closet, ah
Hoes tryna call me a snake, shit, I guess I can relate
'Cause a bitch spit a whole lotta venom
And since these hoes all rats, when they come around me
All I see is a whole lotta dinner
I walk around the house butt-naked
And I stop at every mirror just to stare at my own posterior
I don't give a fuck who talk behind my back
'Cause the bitch knew better than to let me hear her (Ah)

Bitch so hot, gotta stay in bikinis
He got a girl, but he keep beggin' to see me
I love it when a nigga got a mouth full of VVs
No, I'm not a patient, but I let him treat me
I gotta be a doctor how I’m orderin' CCs
Go to your place, no face, no case
Ninety-nine percent tint in a blacked-out Wraith
I remember hoes used to clap for me happily
Now I'm bossed up and them same hoes mad at me
Acting like they ridin', whole time tryna pass me
Watchin' me go through it and still tryna drag me
Actin' like you winnin', if you think about it, actually
Are they supportin' you or really just attackin' me?

Big bank take lil' bank, bitch, add it up
Hoes takin' shots, but they ain't in my caliber
Booked, but I squeeze a lil' head in my calendar
Lookin' in the mirror like, ""Damn, I don't brag enough""
LVs, double C's, Birkins, I'm workin'
My chain ain't hittin' if a bitch ain't hurtin'
Look, I ain't even finna argue with a bitch
One thing I know, two things for certain
None of these hoes sayin' shit to my face
And none of these hoes finna see me at the bank
And I'ma keep talkin' all the shit that I want
And I dare one of these hoes come tell me I can't

So live a life you will remember
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die (Good job, Sho)

See, I'm tryna blow off this music ting
And pray that I end up commercial
And 'bout time that I make some records
Show them why that I go universal
('Cause I can't) 'Cause I can't get stuck in the ends
I need me a yard with a big ass fence

No fake love, no need to pretend
If I cut you off, it's straight intent
Guys out here tryna drill and repent
Same bad B that I need in defence
The J1's coulda been A1, but I can't follow the latest trends
Broski might handle the can and let off shots, 'cause the bullets bisexual
It's really for them boy there, can definitely hit that bitch right next to you

Got my bro like Zack got Cody

I don't wanna feel shit anymore
I don't wanna feel rich anymore
Know that they want me dead
So I'm takin' meds until I fall on the floor
I don't know who to call anymore
I don't know what to call it anymore
Tears fall like raindrops, but nah, I don't wanna ball anymore
Pick up the rock, score
I pill pop some more
Why? It numbs me inside
I know it ain't right, but it's part of the ride
There ain't no place like home
I wanna go back home
I hate the world we know, oh, oh, oh
There ain't no place like home
I wanna go back home

Spirit of a lion describes my soul
Give it up to Zion then my fire grows
Wishing of a riot inside my lobe
And my trippin' is the highest when I fight my foes
Bip, I'ma hit 'em with this, you 'bout to get yo' ass kicked
My technique is so sick, I'm 'bout to make the hit quick
Whole lotta muscle (Chea) you don't wanna be in a tussle (Chea)
Better than me? That's rubble
You want trouble? What's up though? (Chea)
Feelings hot to kill a top guerilla
Drop and kneel to pops, I grilled the opp
For real, ya clock, it yield and stop
Ya will is shot, the deal was knock ya 'til ya plop
I got the hеll comin' yo way (Chea)
You softer than a thing of Yoplait
Nevеr competitive with the better kid, I go cray
Gonna be deaded because I fed it to the Mo', graves (Chea)
When you wake up in that wet blood
Ain't no way you 'bout to get up
How you know that I taxed yo' ass?
'Cause you got the motherfuckin' check stub (Rrr)
Always gonna have to pay costs
When you steppin' in my way, boss
When I build steel and you stay soft
You're gonna punk out when we face off
Rumble, they gon' take your face off
They gon' rumble, they gon' take your face off
They gon' rumble, they gon' take yo' face off
They gon' rumble, they gon' take yo' face off
They gon'—
Rumble there, young man, they rumble
Run up, get a combo quickly
Help you understand but stay humble (Do-do)
Don't nobody wanna talk about the way of the world
The weight of the world'll make 'em all crumble
And I might stumble, but I pick myself up
Brush myself off, my thoughts of a goddamn boss (Woo)
I am at their neck like I'm Malcolm X
Like I'm Dr. King, like I'm Cornel West
Like I'm Huey P., like I'm Booker T
Like I'm Rosa Parks, I'ma need my rest
Niggas know what I'm 'bout I'll run up in yo' house
Feet up all on your couch, sock you right in your mouth
I ain't after no clout, it could really go south
I'm prepared to go to battle whenever there is a bout (Ah)
I am Muhammad
Ali I'm payin' the homage, policy is to be honest
I take it beyond it though
I can relate to ebonics and really I hate to be ominous
All of your hate is too obvious
I am the hustle, the muscle, I play for the audience
I am a gangster with knowledge
If you wanna enter the ring, I would hate to be opposite
Jab with the right, jab with the left
Jab with the right, now you got 'em all staggerin'
He gon' come back with the right, back with the left
That's when you step to the side, now dagger
You gon' be damned if you do, damned if you don't
Bastard, I'm like Cassius, my swagger
It really don't matter pardon, I'm hardened
Lawless, the Martian kickin' that jargon (Ah)
Rumble, they gon' take your face off
They gon' rumble, they gon' take your face off
They gon' rumble, they gon' take yo' face off
They gon' rumble, they gon' take yo' face off
They gon'—
Barber cape off how I'm giving the fade
Based off the description I gave
Cut the game off, I'm a street fighter
Beat the brakes off like the whip on the stage
Hand out ass whippings
My plate haters ate off, yeah, get Hitler a steak
It'll be chaos like an emerald chase
When I face off in a Nicolas Cage
Y-Y-Y-Yeah, I'm living in rage
Punch a pussy nigga like I'm fisting his babe
I was sitting in the 'spital, going mental, doc had told me
They'll forget me but they didn't, I remember them days
And I don't wanna be Batman, nigga, I'm Bane
Literally how the venom enters my veins
Since a little one, Killa really been sick in the brain
And the more I think about it, my life was twisted, wait
Reminiscing on when mom and dad would wonder
Why they couldn't reach me like they didn't have my number
Fighting for my sanity, I never had the hunger
Put a nigga underground quick, that's a bunker
Sh-Shock 'em like I'm Master's brother
Better pick your battles, busters halfway under
Hit more times than acupuncture
When it comes to rumbling, I'm Afro Thunder
Really it be funny when I kick it to you dummies
How I'm grippin' on the iron when I'm rhyming on the mic
Because it really will get bloody like I'm kicking it with buddies
When I beat a nigga up like I was Iron nigga Mike
I tell 'em they don't wanna tussle, when I'm at 'em, they gon' drop
Bet you that he stumble when I jab him then I cross
Leave a nigga humble like, ""Damn"" when Kenny dropped
'Cause really we can rumble like Jackie in the Bronx
We gon'—
Rumble, they gon' take your face off
They gon' rumble, they gon' take your face off
They gon' rumble, they gon' take yo' face off
They gon' rumble, they gon' take yo' face off (Chyeah)
It's about drive, it's about power, we stay hungry, we devour
Put in the work, put in the hours and take what's ours
Black and Samoan in my veins, my culture bangin' with Strange
I change the game so what's my motherfuckin' name? (Rock)
What they gonna get though?
Desecration, defamation, if you wanna bring it to the masses
Face to face now we escalatin' when I have to put boots to asses
Mean on ya like a dream when I'm rumblin'
You're gonna scream, ""Mama""
So bring drama to the king Brahma (Then what?)
Comin' at ya' with extreme mana (Ahoo, ahoo, ahoo)

One day I'll write a story that'll sit on a shelf
About me partying with my friends at some random hotel
And sneaking out the window on a Sunday night
I'd do it on a Friday, but that's obvious, I
Don't wanna lose my trust, but I do it so well
'Cause I'm partying with my friends at some random hotel
Yeah, it's a little fun, stupid, and like really dumb
Pop six pieces of gum before I get home
'Cause we do it so well, yeah, no, they'll never tell
And we're driving a little fast, P.C.H. wasted my gas
Eating pasta in the back, spilling our minds out
Wish our secrets farewell, they stay in this random hotel
'Cause we do it so well, yeah, no, they'll never tell

To captivate every heart?

23;Wallice;Indie Pop;;"In my childhood bedroom
And I'm so bored of twenty-two
Same old nothing every day
Too old to be a runaway
Expiring at my momma's house
Really thought that I'd be out by now
I'm terrified of the future
Scared that I'll still be a loser
And I just can't wait to be
All grown up and twenty-three
And tell me what is wrong with me
I miss my Ohio fake ID
Maybe I'll get married soon
And buy a house with three bedrooms
And settle down and get a dog
And make my partner get a job
Jazz school dropout at twenty-one
Disappointed my dad, did it just for fun
Had to choose between being broke and bored
So I cut my lossеs and I left New York
Not sure why I feel so dumb
Thе best of my years are yet to come
I'll sit and wait in the driveway
It's just a couple more weeks 'til my birthday
I just can't wait to be
All grown up and twenty-three
And tell me what is wrong with me

Leave everything behind

You’re standing on higher ground
But when you hear the sound you realise it’s just the wind
And you notice it matters
Who and what you let under your skin
If put to the test
Would you step back from the line of fire?
Hold everything back
All emotions and desires
Convince yourself
To be someone else
And hide back from the world
Your lack of confidence
What you choose to believe in
Dictates your rise or your fall
Dictates your rise or your fall
With no one else around you
No one to understand you
No one to hear your calls

Hold it in your heart before you lose it
Keep it moving in your solitude steadily breathing
Knowing who you are and what you're seeking
Meet me in the marigold garden shining
Sovereign in the head with your senses heightened
Yellow soul, you are so mellow-minded
Walking through and talking to these little lions
Playing your stereo loud
Flaunting your taste
Blazing the space around you
With love, light and marigold sounds
Pray we live long lives
Seeking our futures out

Elvis Song;Maisie Peters;Indie Pop;https://open.spotify.com/track/6MWH5jDoS1wpMPz8CwuC3N;"(You were always on my mind)
Cold bench on a platform
Last train on the Northern Line
I'm trying to keep you out my mind
Too drunk for a drawbridge
Your name floods when my eyes are shut
We found love
You gave it all and I gave it up
I don't do it often
But when no one's watching
No one's watching
I'm thinking 'bout
Late nights in the old arcade
Drinking cheap wine as Elvis plays
Singing, ""You were always on my mind""
I was yours and you were mine
Breakfast on your sofa bed
Thinking, ""Oh God, I'm in over my head""
You were always on my mind
You're always on my mind
I've got no right to miss you
All I did was kiss and fly
Each time I stayed another night
I was scared to throw my hеart off the edge
Easiеr to tell myself we'd mess it up instead
So I left
But it plays round in my head
I don't do this often
But when no one's watching
No one's watching
I'm thinking 'bout
Late nights in the old arcade
Drinking cheap wine as Elvis plays
Singing, ""You were always on my mind""
I was yours and you were mine
Breakfast on your sofa bed
Thinking, ""Oh God, I'm in over my head""
You were always on my mind
You're always on my mind

You were always, always, always on my mind
(Mind, mind, mind)
You were always, always, always on my mind
In my mind, I hear it and I know nothing's changed
In my mind, we share earphones on the midnight train
And I've tried
You moved on and I moved a little too
But I still wish things were different
Don't you?
I never wanna stop thinking 'bout
Late nights in the old arcade
Drinking cheap wine as Elvis plays
Singing, ""You were always on my mind""
I was yours and you were mine
Breakfast on your sofa bed
Thinking, ""Oh God, I'm in over my head""

I miss the southern Cosmos and the Zinnias, oh, the Zinnias
It comes to me in a dream
In the dead heat and the suffocating wet grip
That's got a hold on my mama, it's Marietta's kiss
Quietly, I'm tempted
Sure sounds nice to settle down for a whilе
Let the real еstate show itself to me
I could wake up with a baby in a sling
Just a couple doors down from Abigail
My sister, man and her ring

I pushed you so far down and I let you sink through the drain
There's a claw on my shoulder
And she's saying the obvious
""You know eventually you're gonna have to be a provider, too""
She's coming closer, I can feel her breathe
I keep forgetting that I'll have a family
If I listen in with my hands cupped and on my knees
I can hear the single obnoxious sigh of relief
I'm born to be somebody, then somebody comes from me
I'll tell you about the Rabbit Moon and when to keep walking
I'll spare you pain, I can feel my shame come through that door
I can't fuck it up if it's not there at all

Now I have it and damn it
It‘s kind of weird
He tells me I‘m pretty
Don't know how to respond
I tell him that he‘s pretty too
Can I say that? Don‘t have a clue
With every passing moment
I surprise myself
I‘m scared of flies
I‘m scared of guys
Someone please help
'Cause I think I‘ve fallen
In love this time
I blinked and suddenly I had a Valentine (Valentine)
What if he‘s the last one I kiss?
What if he‘s the only one I‘ll ever miss?
Maybe I should run, I‘m only twenty-one
I don‘t even know who I want to become
I‘ve lost all control of my heartbeat now
Got caught in a romance with him somehow
I still feel a shock through every bone
When I hear an “I love you”
'Cause now I‘ve got someone to lose
The first one to ever like me back
I‘m seconds away from a heart attack
How the hell did I fall in love this time?
And honestly, I can‘t believe I get to call you mine

Let You Break My Heart Again;Laufey, Philharmonia Orchestra;Jazz;https://open.spotify.com/track/3oX7VxSz6EHHnxKGUjk9sx;"Verse:
Feeling kind of sick tonight
All I’ve had is coffee and leftover pie
It’s no wonder why
Still you take up all my mind
I don’t even think that you care like I do
I should stop
Heaven knows I've tried
Chorus:
One day
I will stop falling in love with you
Some day
Someone will like me like I like you
Until then I’ll drink my coffee
Eat my pie
Pretend that we are more than friends
Then of course I’ll let you break my heart again
Verse:
I’m just tryna understand
What i am to you
More than songs we’ve exchanged
Midnight calls
Sunset views
Promise I don’t mean to cry
But I get overwhelmed and confused
If only you knew
What i felt like
Chorus:
One day
I will stop falling in love with you
Some day
Someone will like me like I like you
Until then I’ll drink my coffee
Eat my pie
Pretend that we are more than friends
Then of course I’ll let you break my heart again

One day
I will stop falling in love with you

Leaves me totally cold

Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face (Talkin' about me?)
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me, why should it be true, mmm, yeah
I get a kick out of you (Me?)
Some, they may go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too
Yet I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you standing there before me

And that's when I fell into the flames
Turns out he's a fool

To go ahead and talk about himself all night

There were angels dining at the Ritz

But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
The moon that lingered over London town
Poor puzzled moon, wore such a frown
How could he know we two were so in love?
The whole darn world seemed upside down
The streets of town were paved with stars
It was such a romantic affair
And when you turned and smiled at me
A nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
How strange it was
How sweet and strange
There was never a dream to compare
What that hazy, crazy night we met
When a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
Ah, this heart of mine beat loud and fast
Like a merry-go-round in a fair
And we were dancing cheek to cheek
When a nightingale sang in Berkeley Square
When dawn came stealing up all gold and blue
To interrupt our rendezvous
I still remember when you smiled and said
""Was that a dream or was it true?""
Our homeward steps were just as light
As the dancing feet of Astaire
And like an echo far away

Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most - Demo;Norah Jones;Jazz;https://open.spotify.com/track/24mo3C5GuVTfoL8vedPMqL;"Once I was a sentimental thing
Threw my heart away each spring
But now a spring romance hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to winter
And all I've got to show's a splinter for my little fling
Spring this year has got me feeling
Like a horse that's never left the post
I lie in my room staring up at the ceiling
Spring can really hang you up the most
Morning's kiss wakes trees and flowers
And to them I'd like to drink a toast
I walk in the park just to kill lonely hours
Spring can really hang you up the most
All winter long, those birds, they twitter-twit
I know the song, ""This is love, this is it""
Heard it before and I know the score
And I've decided that spring is a bore
Doctors once prescribed a tonic
""Sulphur and molasses"" was the dose
That didn't help a bit, my condition must be chronic
Spring can really hang you up the most
I am all alone, the party is over
Old man winter was a gracious host
But when you keep praying for snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most";en;0.9999969873322404

Stardust;Samara Joy;Jazz;https://open.spotify.com/track/60gs0cMpDerQrMDmGOj8LX;"And now the purple dust of twilight time
Steals across the meadows of my heart
High up in the sky those little stars climb
Always reminding me that we're apart
You wonder down the lake, and far away
Leaving me a song that will not die
Love is now the stardust of yesterday
The music of the ears gone by
Sometimes I wonder why I, I spend
The lonely nights dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our lovе was new and each kiss had inspiration
But that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
Bеside a garden wall
When stars are bright, you are in my arms
The nightingale tells his fairytale of paradise where roses grew
Though I dream in vain, in my heart it will remain
My stardust melody, the memory of love’s refrain";en;0.9999976417474048

Pure pedantic, bittersweet to know it
Over-expressive, restless
Past and present, forget the blessings
Forget about the summers that teach us lessons
Searching for a home so I keep on pressing
Early hours, feeling vacant
Back at afters, hands are shaking
Muddled laughter, dawn's cracking
The mood is breaking
The birds are waking, smokе another rollie
Tell anothеr story you already told me
Full of laughter, silent child inside
Eyes wide as when we were five
Nestled feelings, close contact ceilings
Indoors are hopeless for healing
A meaning I'm searching, this hurting's for something
But demons are lurking
Dark times are waiting, the devil's impatient
Stay up on your toes, complacent is baiting
Aiding the vacant, awaiting a chance to be taken
A chance to be taken
Hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on, hold on
If I told you, I'd have to kill you
My better half, I want to feel you
If I told you, I'd have to kill you
My better half, need to feel you
Take a bite, take a slice, take the fucking whole pie
Do it right, tread light when you cross my mind
Reaffirm your stance with a squeeze of hands
And a two-step dance, sipping moonlit cans
Make a wish, catch a lip from an eyelash
Slip, take a hit, flip it right for when we burn at night
Make me earn it right, make us great, don't quit
When it gets real tough, well we can handle shit
What's with the hold up?
What's with the slow love?
Tell me what it is, and I can make that change
I can't control you, don't wanna own you
Tell me how to help, why does this feel so strange?

Nothing holds me captive like you do
The danger within one's grasp
Beautiful but unpredictable

Old now, but always there
Even if the sleeves are longer now

And gladly share half a sorrow
The house is small, the silence is big
She often forces me onto her lap
I still live with Mom
And will probably stay there forever
In the house, a man has been lacking for a long time
I'm helping out as best I can
Mother doesn't give me much love
But she still slaps my face
And now and then I'vе cried
Then she only said with a smilе
A man only cries when his mother dies
Death is strong, the heart is weak
When your own flesh and blood spoils
The cleverer give in
She couldn't love the father either
Driven him out of the world
Now and then a silent scream
And a little litany
Mother didn't give him much love
But she often slapped his face
Now and then he has cried
Then she only said with a smile

You made a deal with the devil in a bloodbath
Now there's a price on your head, seal the contract
Automatic, systematic
We want our pound of flesh and we slice thick
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all, no successors
Flip the script and oppress the oppressors
Finding strength as we sift through the carnage
We want our pound of flesh and we'll take it

Evade the butcher's tax, then write us off
And it's hard to stop the bleeding
Hung from hooks and barely brеathing
But we'll break, break, brеak down the wall again
You tell your stories of the things that you've been through
But they're as false as the teeth that you lie through
Nobody's buying but you sell, sell, sell
In the land of the free you're a slave to your wealth
You fucking fascist
Die you fucking pig
This is the consequence of opulence
You sit back as we collapse, left to fight over scraps
While you auction off our backs to buy your crown
(Force fed the lies)
And it's hard to stop the bleeding
Hung from hooks and barely breathing
But we'll break, break, break down the wall again

We score the final scene, adrenaline now coursing through our veins
Long live our symphony, this infantry survived a thousand suns
Silent they still attack, we fire back with notes instead of guns
We echo, reverberate

Fight
Landmines composed in command lines
Amplify or die, it's us or them
This enclave's tearing through the airwaves
Scrеaming a war-torn requiem
Be not afraid
Trappеd in hypocrisy's cacophony, all tension, no release
When it's so hard to see the harmony, it's time to end the peace
(So stop the peace)
Stop their choir, change their key
Hit back hard in our reprise
Bring their fanfare to its knees
And we'll leave them behind

Amplify or die, it's us or them

Screaming a war-torn requiem
Be not afraid
Don't fall back, orchestrate the fallout
Score the ending of the world on this battleground
Survive yet another militant strike
Half-dead, but we're living up to the hype
Half-dead, as the speakers detonate like
Landmines composed in command lines
Amplify or die, it's us or them (It's us or them)
This enclave's tearing through the airwaves
This is our war-torn requiem
The dawning of a new age

These are the weapons of rebirth (Requiem)

A fuckin' nemesis
Gonna show you how red the flag can get
I got balls the size of Jupiter
If I fall, call me Lucifer
I made a home in the flames
I got fire in my veins
I gotta choose from killing or learning to hide
Dunno if I'm living or burning alive
And I just lie here like this
Left to die
So many times
That deep inside I think I might dеserve it
I walked through firе
Somehow survived
Now I don't know if I'm alive or only burning
Alive or only burning
Bury me here
Under your bed
That's where your treasures and demons are kept
Keep me a secret
Never forget
The best kinda love only ends in cold-blooded revenge
All that I need is a gut feeling
You think I don't hear when you're gossiping
Ass-licking while I'm ass-kicking
Nobody knows what I'm thinking
Everyone's after me
I'm running out of self esteem
Gimme gasoline
Can't you see that I've been
Left to die
So many times
That deep inside I think I might deserve it
I walked through fire
Somehow survived
Now I don't know if I'm alive or only burning
Alive or only burning
Alive or only burning
And I just lie here like this
My soul is in shreds
Tonight is a tomb
Poets are liars but I know the truth
Roses are dead
Violets are doomed
Lovers don't know how to love but they know how to wound
Lovers don't know how to love but they know how to wound
'Cause I've been
Left to die
So many times

Rulers of the wasteland, rejoice in the flames
Futures tumble, legacies crumble
Thousands of years and what have we learned?
They heard the warnings, ignored the signs
Wheels of injustice kept on turning
Unaccountable for their crimes
On the streets anger burning
Black clouds rumble, dark days ahead
As the chorus chants for a holy war
“It’s the end of an era, a new dawn will rise”
Words turned to war, brother fighting brother
Another false truce, as the people die
The fate of the nation forever changed
Behold - the fiery end is nigh
Behind closed doors, corruption wins
The power echelon prepares their task
One step forward, two stabs in the back
Revolution is a mere change of masks?
Black clouds rumble, dark days ahead
As the chorus chants for a holy war
“It’s the end of an era, a new dawn will rise”
We rise again from the stench and the pain
We pass through fire, darkness erase the stain
Black clouds rumble, dark days ahead
As the chorus chants for a holy war

What is life
But a fevered dream?
Their eyes are yet to open
The gears are set in place to guide me to affinity
Atrophy, the thorn of time's aging vine
Harrowing winds press the mesh and curse the flesh
Rotting away
But here in this reality, my thoughts transform fatality
An almost endless exploration of our cosmic minds
Perpetuated through the sands of time
Contort reality, distort fallacy, pave my way
Contort reality, resort to malady
This lucid dream lingers onward, indefinitely
I am one
Omnipotent
I am the one
Icarus
I'll touch the sun
As you sow
And so you shall reap
What is life, if but a fevered dream?
Restless nexus
My consensus
Striking at god at fucking will
Yet I am still not even satisfied
I fabricate, manipulate, incinerate, and duplicate
Restabilize the precipice, my arbitrary exodus inside
Where I confide, looking down on this steeple
Contort reality, distort fallacy, pave my way
Contort reality, resort to malady
This lucid dream lingers onward, indefinitely
I descend
Despairing plunge unto the omniverse
Sinking deeper
We relinquish pasts, as we forget the difference
Losing ourselves in the infinite
Despairing plunge unto the omniverse
Sinking deeper
We relinquish pasts, as we forget the difference
Losing ourselves
As we become

I'll eat the sun
These fragile wings will touch the sky (Touch the sky)
And paint the world in black and white (Black and white)
Bring forth the cleansing fires of rebirth
Recreating my image within the paradoxical
Burn in the embers of my fevered heart
Witness my omnipotence
Cursed judgment, devoid of this flesh, bring for my affinity
I am the omnipotent being

Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm movin' in
He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been
And the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls
Every light is burnin' in a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown
Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night
And the thunder rolls

The thunder rolls, and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on out of control
Deep in her heart the thunder rolls
She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him, thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes, and he knows that she knows

In a world where we weren't blind?

From pain and hate inside

Can we start over, start over?

Porcelain, porcelain
I saw your face, but it couldn't save me
I fell from grace, and I cracked your smile
Don't rescue me, I can't escape it
Ravenously, feed my feral mind
We bend before we break
God knows I tried
But broken, I bow to the beast inside
Covered my tracks but couldn't swallow my pride
As sure as the moonlight strikes our skin

Porcelain, compulsions killing me
Giving in, and I can't go back
Porcelain, it's fucking killing me
Giving in, I can't go back
I've broken my vows to reconcile
I shattered your heart and left a crack in your smile

Name on a toe tag
So cold
Living in a body bag
Think I'm dreaming?
'Cause I'm not feeling anything
Hands tied
Trying to rip the bandage
One breath
Away from the casket
As I'm bleeding
Life won't leave me
But I can't stop thinking
If my world stops spinning
And tomorrow never comes
Will I be remembered?
Did I give enough?
Will I be forgiven
For everything I've done?
What if I don't wake up
And tomorrow never comes?
Every lie
Every word unspoken
I remember every heart
That I've broken
Buried like bones
Beneath my headstone
Did I try?
Did I try
To make amends?
To live and die?
Or did I really just pretend?
Nightmare's talking
As I'm sleepwalking
And I can't stop thinking

Row! Row!
The ships await us by the Birka quay
All prepared with sixty oars
They will carry us on the open sea
Heading out to glory wars
We have blothed to Aegir
To the daughters of Ran
We are willing and eager
We are leaving at dawn
Four days of good wind
Then we awoke to an ocean mirror calm
Slacking sails, we are drifting
No direction, we are drifting
Glory calls from beyond the waves
A chance for fame and rich reward
Honour waits beyond the grave
So put your back into the oar
The sun is burning, now wе're lost at sea
Our rations are running low
Thirsty throats and hungry flеas
But we still got many days to go
We are crossing the ocean
Left our home in the North
The oars have set us in motion
They will carry us forth
Each man builds his own fame
Now everyone, show me what you're worth
Who recalls a coward's name?
No one remembers, who remembers
Glory calls from beyond the waves
Beckons those with a heart for war
Honour waits beyond the grave
So put your back into the oar

Row to glory wars
And for victory

I'm as tough as the crust of the Earth is
I move mountains, I move churches
And I glow, 'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is
Got a rough, indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum, I find 'em, I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but...
Under the surface
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like, ""Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus""?
Under the surface
I'm pretty surе I'm worthless if I can't be of servicе
A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back
What breaks the camel's back? It's
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip, that'll never stop, whoa-oh
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip till you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa-oh
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick till it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer
Who am I if I can't carry it all?
If I falter
Under the surface
I hide my nerves and it worsens, I worry somethin' is gonna hurt us
Under the surface
The ship doesn't swerve, has it heard how big the iceberg is?
Under the surface
I think about my purpose, can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominoes, a light wind blows
You try to stop it topplin', but on and on it goes
Wait
If I could shake the crushing weight
Of expectations, would that free some room up for joy
Or relaxation, or simple pleasure?
Instead, we measure this growing pressure
Keeps growing, keep going, 'cause all we know is
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa-oh
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip till you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt and
See if she can handle every family burden
Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
No mistakes, just
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa-oh
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick till it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Give it to your sister and never wonder
If the same pressure would've pulled you under
Who am I if I don't have what it takes?
No cracks, no breaks
No mistakes!

Deny it when the pageant flops
Go
They spew it, nothing to it
Just another cycle of abuse, propaganda on a loop
Sermon, so determined
To be the live grenade, a predatory game
Adrift lost in the cybеr sea
A movement consuming, contеntious hate is blooming
Aimed to harden the divide
United by a story in your melting pot of misery
Hold yourself a prophet but you're really just a comedy
We won't take this anymore
Let me say it one more time
Look into the darkness
Web of crooked thoughts
Lobotomized and left to rot (Corpse nation)
Feed into the promise
Worship every drop
Deny it when the pageant flops (Corpse nation, corpse nation)
Oh my god, they're horrifying
Violence, systemic virus
Please take a seat and read the room
Ignorance will be your doom
Contagious, hysteric rages
But it's time to let the rhetoric go up in flames
Assault with your cryptic words
Uncensored ramblings to a brain dead herd
Agenda tailored for supremacy
Indoctrinated fallacy
Look into the darkness
Web of crooked thoughts
Lobotomized and left to rot (Corpse nation)
Feed into the promise
Worship every drop
Deny it when the pageant flops (Corpse nation, corpse nation)
Malignant manifesto
Two-bit horror show
If truth's what makes you shudder
Research this, motherfucker
Blegh
Where you go one you'll all fall
I won't, I won't, I won't stand back and bite my tongue
Where you go one you'll all fall
Disillusioned, where are you now?
Stare into the darkness
Web of crooked thoughts
Lobotomized and left to rot (Corpse nation)
Malignant manifesto
Worship every drop
Deny it when the pageant flops (Corpse nation, mutation, corpse nation, damnation now)

When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned

And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called

I shake and I think about the powers at play, the powers at play
And the kids in the dark that were doomed from the start
The child in the basement, face to the pavement

Love is a constant, love is a basis
He cannot be, she cannot be, they cannot be changed

Ooh, ooh
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone

Show no love 'cause it's hard to receive

I can't even finish school

Who fought fires so violent 
I think I bored my therapist

(Oh my God) That's so insane
(Oh my God) That's such a shame
Next to them, my shit don't feel so grand
But I can't help myself from feeling bad
I kinda feel like two things can be sad

Really needs an audience

And spew my tiny symphony
Just let me play my violin for you, you, you, you

He was such a noble dude
Man, I feel like such a fool
I got so much left to prove

Somewhere someone's got it worse
Wish that made it easier
Wish I didn't feel the hurt

Really needs an audience
So if I do not find somebody soon
I'll blow up into smithereens
And spew my tiny symphony
All up and down a city street
While tryna put my mind at ease
Like finishing this melody
This feels like a necessity
So this could be the death of me
Or maybe just a better me
Now come in with the timpanis
And take a shot of Hennessy

I like to see you wiggle, wiggle, for sure
It makes me want to dribble, dribble, you know
Riding in my Fiat, you really have to see it
Six-feet-two in a compact, no slack
But luckily the seats go back
I got a knack to relax in my mind
Sipping some red, red wine
Shepherd's Bush, my compact push
Notting Hill Gate, my Fiat skate
With a crate of Cabernet, but not today
Because I gotta drive, I wanna stay alive
Not 'cause it's illicit, do I have to get explicit?
As a matter of fact, I sip on the yak
With Big and Reecе, 200 diamonds in their piece
I'm trying to gеt mine, so I can shine

The last few months, I've been workin' on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones who loved me, baby
I look back now and I realize
And I remember when I held you
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Ah)
If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Give me one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like I shoulda loved you all the time
And I remember when I held you (Held you, baby)
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay (Never again, baby)
And I regret I didn't tell you (Hey)
Now I can't keep you from loving him

Said I had you to myself, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Uh)
Out of time
Out of time
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely engulfed in the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame
You may even forget your own name

Funny, now I hate you

All the hours spent givin' advice on how to write your songs
All you did was prove me wrong
When you said you loved me
Well, you must've had your fingers crossed
Shoulda paid attention to my friends
Tellin' me how bad it's gonna end
Always givin' their opinions

Like one day you'll come back to me

2step (feat. Lil Baby);Ed Sheeran, Lil Baby;Pop;https://open.spotify.com/track/1qqSQhDwPXl8WY0Fxx9kIt;"I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us
What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I got nothin' left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best, and the rest are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays and
We'll go all night

Then you'd kiss me and I'd smile, did you even know?
When you'd say that kinda thing, I'd be excited
Got me hopin' maybe one day you would mean it
Always thought I'd only make a fool of someone else
Now you've only gone and made me make one of myself
I guess that flowers aren't just used for big apologies
I guess I should've been more conscious how you spoke to me
'Cause when we'd fight, you give me space and not communicate
And for a while, I thought that's what I should appreciate
Maybe I was holdin' on to what I thought you were
But when you think too hard, eventually, it starts to hurt
The version of you in my head now I know wasn't true
Young people fall for the wrong people, guess my one was you
I was gettin' any flight so we could make it work
You'd ignore me, coulda told me you were seein' her
Kinda hate myself for justifyin' your mistakes
Took a minute, but I learned that shit the hard way
Who are you to tell me I can't be heartbroken?
Babe, you had the chance, the door for you was open
If it's what you need to tell yourself to sleep at night
Pretend I haven't found a man who finally treats me right
I guess that flowers aren't just used for big apologies
I guess I should've been more conscious how you spoke to me
'Cause when we'd fight, you give me space and not communicate
And for a while, I thought that's what I should appreciate
Maybe I was holdin' on to what I thought you were
But when you think too hard, eventually, it starts to hurt
The version of you in my head now I know wasn't true
Young people fall for the wrong people, guess my one was you
If there's anything I've learned, it's you should watch yourself
If it's hurting you, then leave and go and get some help";en;0.999996823815624

'Cause I'm done bein' extra with the extroverts
The label used to wonder how I'm supposed to stand next to Vert
Prolly never thought that I would get these legs to work
I work hard, but hard shit don't need no extra work
That's why I show up in a sweatshirt and let it burn
The world's mine, I just say, ""Fuck it, let it turn""
The girl's mine, I just say, ""Fuck it, have a turn""
The G.O.A.T.s call me to the side like, ""Can we have a word?""
I could've fronted but I did this shit how I preferred (I preferred)
Mmm, I know I should be humble, but it's somethin' I just haven't learned
Soon enough I have to make these bad habits burn
Soon enough we 'bout to come and get the shit we earn
You not a fan now, but I remember when you used to be fanned out
I'm guessin' when the whole world loves you, people only got one way to stand out
All that time in the kitchen finally panned out
I put some flavor in a pot and took the bland out
I know my grandpa would have a heart attack if I pulled a hunnid grand out
So I'm not gonna pull a hunnid grand out
I'm hip-hop, do you fully understand?
Fully automatic with the jams and they don't jam
At the shows I'm 'bout to start handin' out programs
'Cause y'all need to get with the program
I'm a grown-ass man, call me pops
Fuck around and take your phone ass man
Everybody know Jack, but they don't know Jack, man
They just know I got the flows and the hoes and the packed out shows
Ain't too many cons when you playin' with the pros
'Cept for how your life get exposed, but I make that sacrifice for the life that I chose
I know in Toronto they got salt for the roads
But schools closed in Kentucky, so I like when it snowed
The kids carry chopsticks not for rice in the bowl
School counselors all know how they life is at home
Cold like the Minnesota Vikings at home
Before I met Drizzy, I knew he and I would get along
But it's hard to crack jokes when you really want advice

Once in a lifetime, 'til I say I want it twice
One of a kind, know your everything is one of mine
Wanted posters with my face, they know who I'm wanted by

Yeah
Cold hearts and heated floors
No parental guidance, I just see divorce
Therapy sessions, I'm in the waiting room, readin' Forbes
Abandonment issues I'm gettin' treated for
How much water can I fit under the bridge before it overflows?
My son's gotta learn that forgiveness is a lonely road
The cribs on his will like motor homes

They only finesse you when you don't move properly

Are linkin' up with people that don't fuck with me to fuck with me
This shit is gettin' ugly

And every thing they sayin' is irrational
And every way they movin' is promotional
Everybody's actin' irreplaceable, it's like they ain't disposable
My urges for revenge are uncontrollable
I know we're gettin' older though, yeah
But I gotta get a nigga back for that, it's non-negotiable
It's not even debatable
I'm gettin' so rich, my music's not even relatable
I blow her head up, it's an inflatable
Baby blue G class, I feel like a kid again
Prayin' on my downfall don't make you religious, man
All I hear is plug talk comin' from middleman
All I hear is tall tales comin' from little men
When I say ""Bitch,"" I'm very rarely referrin' to women
Most of the bitches I know are niggas, they not even women
I know that sounds like I'm bein' funny, I'm not even kidding
Same ones that say they run the game when they not even in it
To be honest, y'all financial situation's my biggest motivation
And how you should take that statement is based on what you makin'
Whips and chains like a dominatrix, wap, pssh
If I see ya, I spit in ya faces, ha-tu
Daytonas with the green faces
Kentucky derby races, my presence in the spot is so abrasive
Box at the Churchill Downs, that's motivation, yeah

Done bein' distracted
The one I need is right in my arms (Oh)

You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time

If you don't trust him a little

Out of time
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely engulfed in the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever

Honestly, truthfully, okay, I get that
I feel like I know I gotta wake up in the morning and go to work (I feel like there can be a-uh, maybe)

Impossible, from a Prius to gold carriages
Middle finger to you so you see what a whole karat is
I need a answer, a reader of more tarots
You couldn't tell that the both of us needed a whole therapist
I made you fam when I greeted your whole parents
But later, I realized they ain't teach you what no sharin' is

Well, luck came and died 'round here

Botox into the brain

The Foundations of Decay;My Chemical Romance;Rock;https://open.spotify.com/track/6Pif6RkFoYzLygdqktus4Q;"See the man who stands upon the hill
He dreams of all the battles won
But fate had left its scars upon his face
With all the damage they had done
And so tired with age
He turns the page
Let the flesh
Submit itself to gravity
Let our bodies lay while our hearts will stay
Let our blood invade if I die in pain
Now, if your convictions were a passing phase
May your ashes feed the river in the morning rays
And as the vermin crawls
We lay in the foundations of decay
He was there, the day the towers fell
And so he wandered down the road
And we would all build towers of our own
Only to watch the rooms corrode
But it's much too late
You're in the race
So we'll press
And press 'til you can't take it anymore
Let our bodies lay while our hearts will stay
Let our blood invade if I die in pain
And if, by his own hand, his spirit flies
Take his body as a relic to be canonized, now
And so he gets to die a saint
But she will always be a whore
(You look stressed out!)
Against faith (Antihero)
Against all odds (As if it must be pure)
Against change (Wander through the ruins)
We are free (The guiltiness is yours)
You must fix your heart
And you must build an altar where it rests
When the storm decays and the sky it rains
Let it flood, let it flood, let it wash away
And as you stumble through your last crusade
Will you welcome your extinction in the morning rays?
And as the swarming calls, we lay in the foundations
Yes, it comforts me much more
Yes, it comforts me much more
To lay in the foundations of decay

Every now and then we get that feeling in our chests
Some days, I'm a loser, brush my teeth in the dark
Head above water in a swimming pool of sharks
Ooh, it's hard to get up out of bed
When everything is on its head
And nothing seems to make any sense
Like a Band-Aid on a bleeding heart
I fake a smile and fall apart
And no one ever knows I'm a wreck
When the world is on your shoulders
And the weight of your own heart is too much to bear
Wеll, I know that you're afraid things will always be this way
It's just a bad day, not a bad life
Evеrything's backwards and I'm hangin' on
No matter how hard I try, I always come undone
Backed in a corner, uncomfortably numb
Watching myself become a shadow of someone
Oh, it's hard to find a place to hide
When you're runnin' from what's inside
No matter where you go, there you are
So tonight I'll go to war with me
'Cause I'm my own worst enemy
And I don't wanna fight anymore
When the world is on your shoulders

There must be peace and understanding sometimes
Strong winds of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell mе why, oh why?

Wе're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain

Still, I am sure that the answer
The answer's gonna come somehow

How many tears till I ground myself 'cause no one cries for me?
If there's a God, why'd he let the Devil do his work on me? Oh yeah

Still, you step right up and get smacked back down
In the heat of battle, blood congeals on the floor
Another life force bleeds out, another soul out the door
Antisocial, sadistic, the ""Deity of War""
I stuff body bags, and I'm packing the morgue
No time for remorse over unclaimed remains
It's just flotsam and jetsam, and it's circling the drain

Can't find my soul in the debris

Lift the rubble and all you gon' find is the ashes
Moment of silence as I spiral down, learn from the crashes
Cautious, the metamorphosis gon' get you
Wolf in sheep's clothing, hope your eyes don't trick you
Ain't the first time like meetin' and greetin'
Internal the bleeding on all fours like the seasons

Wait, my head's spinning like Apaches
There's poison in my blood, but it's feeling like an attachment (Word)
Roars out like lions, I'm fire breathing with dragons
Surrounded, but so high, there's a carpet and I'm Aladdin
I'm asking, can you imagine feeling behind the past? And
I lost my soul, I lost that hope
Been carrying 'round that cross like a Pope do
Drownin' in that water, lucky I got on them boat shoes
All I was was hopeful
The transformation ain't myself, I can't keep control
See, I'm screaming for some help, I just wanna let go

Hm, don't ever push my buttons
You might see the other side quicker, Benjamin Button
Shark bait to 'em, hook 'em and gut 'em, seeing me plummet
I keep on runnin', but that black hole keep on suckin', what?

I wanna try, I wanna care
I wanna feel alive like I used to
I wanna be someone, do something
But it feels a little like sleepwalking
I'm faded out
I keep trying to stand, but I'm falling down
I'm stuck inside a loop, why can't I shake it off?
Is it not enough to wanna get better?
I'm faded out
And it's not getting better
Give me something real to hold onto
'Cause I don't know what's real anymore
I'm walking through the haze tryin' to find you
The person that I was before
I gave it all, and I found a hole
That I didn't know was hiding
Thought I knew who I was, looks like I was wrong
And I've been out lost sleepwalking
I'm faded out
I keep trying to stand, but I'm falling down
I'm stuck inside a loop, why can't I shake it off?
Is it not enough to wanna get better?
I'm faded out
And it's not getting better
I wanna find some piece of mind
I need a lifeline, please somebody, please somebody
I can't seem to wake up
Something's gotta give before I give up
I can't live like this
I hate everything I feel 'cause I don't feel anything anymore
And I don't know why
I just wanna stop time to catch my breath

Once our empires glorious, but now the empire's gone
The dead gave us the time to live and now our time is done
Now we are victorious, we've become our slaves
A land of hope and glory building graveyards for the brave

Ignorance our judge and jury, all we've got to show
From Hollywood to Babylon, holy war to kingdom come
On a trail of dust and ashes when the burning sky is done
A tide of change is coming and that is what you fear
The earthquake is a-coming, but you don't want to hear

What if it takes the fall for me to learn to fly

And it cost me everyone, all it left me was feeling numb
Sunrise stayed up ‘til the morning
Eyes stay bloodshot from the smoking
Another round and I’m locked and loaded
Faith has faded
Living on the edge one foot in the coffin
Lord knows I don’t pray too often
Knees down when thе devil come calling
Ain’t no saving
Dead man walking
A dеad man walking
Russian roulette, I swear I don’t have many chances left
No I should change, but man I swear I’d rather dance with death
I’m just a desperate soul
Another broken human
I know some stars are falling
I know some stars are shooting
I get so high
I’m froze in time
Shattered pieces fell on the floor of a heart no longer pure

Crushеd by the weight of your crucible

Goes a pretty long way
Take a look at where you started from

You got knocked down and kept goin'
In the end you know you've got to say
A little bit of love goes a pretty long way
All your wounds are healing fine
I'm so glad I got you in my life
Now the winter frost is gone
Now is our chance to live the life we want
A little bit, a little bit of love
Goes a pretty long way
Everybody, evеrybody's lost
And that's okay
Some show it, some hide it
But thеre's a battle we're all fighting

Holding onto the rabbit's feet
Walking down the sunny side of the street
Shadows creeping at your back
You can forget 'em like an amnesiac
A little bit, a little bit of love
Goes a pretty long way
Love is really like a wonder drug
Let's medicate
And say goodbye to the drama
It's a beeline to nirvana

Goes a pretty long way

And where you are today
You climbed mountains, you swam oceans
You got knocked down and kept goin'
In the end, you know you've got to say
A little bit of love goes a pretty long way

Ain’t No Thief;Viagra Boys;Rock;https://open.spotify.com/track/1gPRoX2iVsbJnkWBGrW7Kg;"I showed up to the party in my favourite coat
On the back was an image of a shrimp on a boat
When you saw what I was wearing you got real upset
And said, “that's the jacket that I got from my grandma”
And well I promise I ain't seen you before
And maybe your grandma had bought a couple more
And maybe I helped her at the grocery store
And she gave it to me as a gift
So quit bitchin', motherfucker
I went out to the porch to light a cigarette
I have six to seven lighters in my left pocket
I took out the one that said Shrimp City Beach 1993
And you told me that's where you had your birthday party
And that the lighters were given as gifts
But I was there too, just dipping my toes down on the beach, man
And I had that lighter specifically made for me, motherfucker

We just happen to have the same stuff, motherfucker, ooh
I recall buyin' this
I recall buyin' this exact lighter when I was 15 years old
My grandpappy gave it to me as a present
Because I had just finished Boy Scout trainin'
And he was so proud of me, that he decided
To create this lighter in the exact same image of yours
I said, I ain't no thief

Tonight is a tomb
Poets are liars but I know the truth
Roses are dead
Violets are doomed
Lovers don't know how to love but they know how to wound
I'm a walking apocalypse
A fuckin' nemesis
Gonna show you how red the flag can get
I got balls the size of Jupiter
If I fall, call me Lucifer
I made a home in the flames
I got fire in my veins
I gotta choose from killing or learning to hide
Dunno if I'm living or burning alive
And I just lie here like this
Left to die
So many times
That deep inside I think I might dеserve it
I walked through firе
Somehow survived
Now I don't know if I'm alive or only burning
Alive or only burning
Bury me here
Under your bed
That's where your treasures and demons are kept
Keep me a secret
Never forget
The best kinda love only ends in cold-blooded revenge
All that I need is a gut feeling
You think I don't hear when you're gossiping
Ass-licking while I'm ass-kicking
Nobody knows what I'm thinking
Everyone's after me
I'm running out of self esteem
Gimme gasoline
Can't you see that I've been
Left to die
So many times

For someone to hear you scream?

Before it fails to witness?
Before it gets a fair chance to start?

Backseat and butterflies
A song for flesh utensils
